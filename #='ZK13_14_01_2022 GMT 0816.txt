Nekogirl: i hate improv
Themooserapist: It shows lol
Nekogirl: yeah
Themooserapist: Tina Fey wants you to try saying ‚Äúyes and‚Äù rather than ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúbut‚Äù and see what happens sometimes

Themooserapist: Emotional pain is whatever 
Themooserapist: Headaches you have my sympathy 
Blue_jollyrancher: how do you stop it

Themooserapist: Emotional pain? Study stoic philosophy 
Themooserapist: Or Buddhism 
Nekogirl: that is the first thing i agree with you on moose
Blue_jollyrancher: drugs got it
Themooserapist: Not too much Buddhism though it gets weird 
Nekogirl: stoicism is a great thing to practice 
Themooserapist: Just the main bits none of the chanting lol
Themooserapist: Same thing with stoicism just the main bits 
Themooserapist: Stoicism goes a bit weird when you get further into it 
Blue_jollyrancher: I'm too confused
Nekogirl: yeah dont lose feeling, just enough to lessen emotional blows
Themooserapist: Emotional control and resilience is a necessity for adult life 
Generic: i tried practicing stoicism for like a week. im aint emotionally stable enough for that shit x-x

Themooserapist: Shocker lol
Nekogirl: yes and almost no one in this generation has it
Blue_jollyrancher: drugs numb it
Themooserapist: I know I am glad I grew up in the 70s and 80s
Generic: hol up hol up
Themooserapist: I got beat up and beat people up and did drugs and skipped school and still turned out ok 
Nekogirl: someone sued a person for harrassment because they tickled them, which technically falls under harrassment
Generic: GREW UP in the 70s and 80s????

Themooserapist: Need to get me some 
Generic: lmao he was tellin me afterwards that he was seein shit
Generic: like everybody was green and he felt like he was in a box x-x
Generic: but yea the problem is this happened at school
Generic: sooo.
Themooserapist: I never went to school much lol
Generic: ill prolly get probation for like 6-12 months
Generic: bs
Generic: literally more than half the kids at my school do drugs (mostly weed) but they dont take every single one of them mfs to court
Generic: its all bc the kid had a reaction.
Themooserapist: In Canada not only would you not even be charged we would all laugh at the kid 
Generic: wait is weed legal nationwide in canada?
Themooserapist: Yup I buy from a dispensary a block from my place and it‚Äôs cheaper than my old dealer 
Themooserapist: Pay tax and everything lol
Generic: goddamn
Generic: lucky mfs
Themooserapist: Long time coming I remember buying weed in Washington State before it was legal in Canada and being jealous of you lol
Generic: either way
Generic: im still underrage
Generic: so
Themooserapist: Yeah don‚Äôt start until you are in your late 20s early 30s like I did 
Generic: too late x0x
Themooserapist: Brain is done developing then and the weed doesn‚Äôt do much permanent stuff 
Generic: plus ive dabbled in other more questionable things
Themooserapist: Lol ah well I was lucky I just drank until I got into white collar office shit and needed a substance abuse disorder like everyone else and weed made more sense than booze 
Themooserapist: Now I know I saved my brain a bit too lol
Generic: i aint talkin alcohol
Themooserapist: I didn‚Äôt do shrooms or mdma until I was in my 30s too
Generic: ive been wanting to try shrooms
Themooserapist: Weird as hell 
Generic: but i aint have no one ive felt comfortable doing it with
Themooserapist: Always gave me bad gas and dry heaves 
Generic: and u aint catchin me doin that shit by myself
Themooserapist: Yeah no you want a babysitter 
Generic: id prolly wake up naked in the middle of the woods
Themooserapist: My first time I did 7 grams and was hallucinating wildly for a solid eight hours 
Generic: goddamn
Themooserapist: Never did that much again lol
Generic: i almost did acid once. but the situation just wasnt right
Themooserapist: MDMA is the perfect drug but I got lucky I did MDMA on the west coast about fifteen years ago
Themooserapist: When there was no fentanyl 
Generic: yea fentanyl seems to be in everything these days
Themooserapist: Just mdma and mdma cut with speed 
Generic: scary as shit
Themooserapist: I wouldn‚Äôt trust anything now 
Themooserapist: I just smoke weed 
Generic: fair
Themooserapist: Pure Molly is a pretty unique experience 
Themooserapist: I am lucky :)
Themooserapist: I still have three pills left from a batch I bought fifteen years ago 
Themooserapist: They keep forever 
Generic: only pills ive done are percocets and xanax. but i mean those are pretty easy to get these days
Themooserapist: Maybe when I am 50 
Themooserapist: The only MDMA I would ever trust lol
Generic: percs always made me nauseous so id crush them up and snort them
Themooserapist: Because I bought ten pills and did seven of them 
Themooserapist: Anything opiod makes me sick 
Generic: id honestly try most things under the right circumstance.
Themooserapist: I only wanted to try things that offered enhancement and peak experiences 
Generic: 3 things i wont touch. heroin, coke, and meth
Themooserapist: MDMA and high dose mushrooms qualify 
Themooserapist: God I got offered coke a lot back in my clubbing days but never did it the MDMA was always enough for me 
Themooserapist: Coke just turned people into assholes 
Generic: im jus scared of how good it will feel.
Themooserapist: Expensive too and addictive as hell 
Generic: plus again with the fentanyl shit
Themooserapist: MDMA has no physical addictive properties at all 
Themooserapist: No withdrawal and mushrooms sure doesn‚Äôt 
Themooserapist: Yeah these days I would just stick with weed 
Themooserapist: Smoke it or eat/dab if you need more 
Generic: ive only done eddies a handful of times. can never handle the taste
Themooserapist: Edibles?
Generic: but that also might be bc ive only done hella concentrated homemade ones
Generic: and yea.
Themooserapist: I make wicked brownies, no weed taste at all and they will blow your hair back 
Themooserapist: My ex is even better lol

Panzershrek: anyone up yet?
Panzershrek: Ah welp another morning of me talking to myself
Trees_the_proto: fluff was on, im on reddit...
Panzershrek: ello trees
Panzershrek: How has life been?
Trees_the_proto: shit
Panzershrek: I see
Panzershrek: any sign of neko?
Trees_the_proto: neko...,  haven't really seen em...
Trees_the_proto: not even on discord...
Panzershrek: Do you think that her parents might have caught her?
Panzershrek: ah shit ive gtg
Trees_the_proto: idfk
Panzershrek: alright im back
Trees_the_proto: yeah idk bout neko...
Panzershrek: If her parents caught her then theres nothing we can do
Panzershrek: She unfriended me on discord for some reason
Panzershrek: so i cant call or message her
Trees_the_proto: me too, tbh...
Panzershrek: She also unfriended you>
Panzershrek: ?
Trees_the_proto: ye
Panzershrek: That deeply worries me
Panzershrek: If she unfriended both of us, that could mean that it was a last ditch effort to get rid of any evidence
Panzershrek: It might mean that her parents grew suspicious of her activity with us and planned to search her phone
Trees_the_proto: she told me why one day, think it was "I dont wanna have my folks see random people on there who aren't on my phone" i dont really fucking remember...
Panzershrek: You can go thru the logs right?
Panzershrek: discord lets you search for the line
Trees_the_proto: she said it on cards.
Panzershrek: oh
Panzershrek: The last thing she said to me was "Im jealous"
Panzershrek: I had told her about the "Object" I bought off amazon
Panzershrek: But thats not important
Trees_the_proto: uh?
Trees_the_proto: wha-
Panzershrek: She may be grounded, perhaps her parents found something they werent supposed to see
Panzershrek: She was buying "Questionable" outfits from amazon right?
Panzershrek: Her parents might have found one
Panzershrek: that would be very hard to explain
Trees_the_proto: how questionable we talkin?
Panzershrek: Like maid dress questionable
Trees_the_proto: ah...
Trees_the_proto: probably...
Panzershrek: stuff only for the eyes of the beholder
Trees_the_proto: yeah....
Panzershrek: if my parents found any of the stuff i have, i would be disowned immediately.
Trees_the_proto: whatcha got thru pm?
Panzershrek: well lets go thru the list
Panzershrek: although im not sure you wanna hear it
Panzershrek: actually nah
Panzershrek: ill just tell you that the last thing i got were handcuffs
Panzershrek: sadly they had a safety release which was disappointing to say the least
Panzershrek: oh
Panzershrek: oh shit
Panzershrek: anyway im not exactly sure how im gonna get rid of the safety release
Trees_the_proto: But kinky‚Ä¶.
Panzershrek: Indeed, nice to know im not the only one
Panzershrek: Im thinking maybe a heavyduty wirecutter
Trees_the_proto: Yea‚Ä¶
Panzershrek: The only real saw that I can access is at school in my robotics class
Panzershrek: we use it to saw thru metal
Panzershrek: it saws thru metal like butter
Panzershrek: but its kinda hard to get handcuffs into such a high profile area
Panzershrek: my 3rd idea was to use a file but im not sure if it would work
Trees_the_proto: Yea, 
Panzershrek: it sucks since on the page it said nothing about a safety release
Trees_the_proto: Got any like handsaws at your place?
Panzershrek: and on the picture i didnt see the safety release since it was covered by the fluff
Panzershrek: ive got a handsaw for cutting wood but it aint an electic one
Trees_the_proto: Ah, best out of luck‚Ä¶
Trees_the_proto: Hmmm
Panzershrek: Could a leaf cutter perhaps work?
Panzershrek: the ones with the long ass blade
Trees_the_proto: Probably would break the cuffs with it
Panzershrek: The safety release is a little lever that sticks out 
Trees_the_proto: Eh maybe‚Ä¶
Panzershrek: If i can cut down the lever to the point is no longer a lever
Panzershrek: and I cant reach the lever
Panzershrek: then theres no problem
Trees_the_proto: Probably work
Trees_the_proto: Idrfk
Panzershrek: the lever is made out of metal though
Trees_the_proto: Well I gtg, cheers panzer
Panzershrek: see ya
Panzershrek: good luck in your endeavours
Trees_the_proto: Remember to hide your evidence 
Panzershrek: see ya trees
