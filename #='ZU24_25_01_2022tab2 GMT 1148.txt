Generic
: this?
Charles_fenton
: Yeah that
Charles_fenton
: Played that a bit and just went back on all my old Minecraft worlds... the old days where I played with dozens of my old friends, and we'd spend hours fucking around and blowing shit up, or making massive shopping plazas
Generic
: ight
Charles_fenton
: Its... odd playing on something like that, where it was once populated so densely, and you leave for a bit, come back and nobody is there, its this apocalyptic feeling and it... it just makes me depressed
Charles_fenton
: like this deep feeling of bittersweet nostalgia, like you know the good old times, but they've passed... and no matter how hard you ask them... they will never come back to play again
Generic
: this is giving me fallout vibes for some reason
Charles_fenton
: Yeah, its a slowed down and distorted version of a gala song
Charles_fenton
: So its already got a classical undertone
Generic
: ok so like. wuts the most fucked up song on the entire project
Charles_fenton
: Probably the one that hit the hardest, was a world we had going, started in like 2014, and its still going... but its empty and desolate, the only noises for miles on end are the ambient noises, and the occasional animal that escaped a pen... also its the whole track
Generic
: bro wut x-x
Charles_fenton
: I just kinda sat and wandered around a bit, looking at old store fronts we made and thinking of the stupid skits we did...
Charles_fenton
: Old minecraft worlds and Burning memory
Generic
: oh ur still talking abt roblox
Generic
: my bad
Charles_fenton
: so nostalgic but bittersweet, because you have such fond memories of the worlds, but now its empty... and no matter how hard you try, you'll never fill it to the level it was, the stupid skits and the joy... all gone
Generic
: bro. 
Generic
: this project is SIX AND A FUCKING HALF HOURS LONG???
Charles_fenton
: yeah, its a damn good album
Generic
: i dont have the attention span for that shit x-x
Charles_fenton
: I dont either, but playing through it on old worlds helped, just wandering and reminiscing 
Generic
: but i am extremely curious
Generic
: id skip to the last stage but idk. the thought of slowly descending into madness tickles my curious side
Charles_fenton
: Yeah, the first few tracks are bittersweet, remembering the good memories as they fade, along with cognitive function
Generic
: maybe ill jus listen to like 10 minutes of each stage
Charles_fenton
: each track is roughly 3-8 minutes...
Generic
: so.....1-3 tracks each stage.
Charles_fenton
: yeah,
Charles_fenton
: also this video does a good job of summarizing that feeling of wandering old minecraft worlds that you used to play with friends on

Generic

: Yeah that
Charles_fenton
: Played that a bit and just went back on all my old Minecraft worlds... the old days where I played with dozens of my old friends, and we'd spend hours fucking around and blowing shit up, or making massive shopping plazas
Generic
: ight
Charles_fenton
: Its... odd playing on something like that, where it was once populated so densely, and you leave for a bit, come back and nobody is there, its this apocalyptic feeling and it... it just makes me depressed
Charles_fenton
: like this deep feeling of bittersweet nostalgia, like you know the good old times, but they've passed... and no matter how hard you ask them... they will never come back to play again
Generic
: this is giving me fallout vibes for some reason
Charles_fenton
: Yeah, its a slowed down and distorted version of a gala song
Charles_fenton
: So its already got a classical undertone
Generic
: ok so like. wuts the most fucked up song on the entire project
Charles_fenton
: Probably the one that hit the hardest, was a world we had going, started in like 2014, and its still going... but its empty and desolate, the only noises for miles on end are the ambient noises, and the occasional animal that escaped a pen... also its the whole track
Generic
: bro wut x-x
Charles_fenton
: I just kinda sat and wandered around a bit, looking at old store fronts we made and thinking of the stupid skits we did...
Charles_fenton
: Old minecraft worlds and Burning memory
Generic
: oh ur still talking abt roblox
Generic
: my bad
Charles_fenton
: so nostalgic but bittersweet, because you have such fond memories of the worlds, but now its empty... and no matter how hard you try, you'll never fill it to the level it was, the stupid skits and the joy... all gone
Generic
: bro. 
Generic
: this project is SIX AND A FUCKING HALF HOURS LONG???
Charles_fenton
: yeah, its a damn good album
Generic
: i dont have the attention span for that shit x-x
Charles_fenton
: I dont either, but playing through it on old worlds helped, just wandering and reminiscing 
Generic
: but i am extremely curious
Generic
: id skip to the last stage but idk. the thought of slowly descending into madness tickles my curious side
Charles_fenton
: Yeah, the first few tracks are bittersweet, remembering the good memories as they fade, along with cognitive function
Generic
: maybe ill jus listen to like 10 minutes of each stage
Charles_fenton
: each track is roughly 3-8 minutes...
Generic
: so.....1-3 tracks each stage.
Charles_fenton
: yeah,
Charles_fenton
: also this video does a good job of summarizing that feeling of wandering old minecraft worlds that you used to play with friends on

Charles_fenton

Charles_fenton
: like I love the song and it does its job beautifully... but damn if it doesn't open old wounds
Generic
: it aint something id listen to on the regular
Charles_fenton
: Me neither, but it is a good song for playing fallout with 
Generic

Mommymilkers42069
