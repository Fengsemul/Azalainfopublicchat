Kitsune_izzy: My name is Jimmy. I am a former Christian who found Jesus on my own two years ago. God saved me with nothing. Absolutely nothing. So I do not belong to any church because I do not believe any church tells the whole story. Therefore, I have decided to make my own church. My church is Christ himself and I do not care who attends. I believe that everyone is on their own path and it is our job to get them to Christ.

Kitsune_izzy: heese milk shake, also known as cheese milkshake or cheese milkshake and occasionally as cheese smoothie, is a soft, dairy-based drink made with whipped cream, milk and cheese. It is typically made with a type of ice cream called ice cream, though it can be made with other soft desserts. It may also be made using frozen yogurt, which is simply Greek yogurt that is mixed with ice cream and flavors to create the drink. The consistency of cheese milk shake is often creamy, as are the flavors used.
