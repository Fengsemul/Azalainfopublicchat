Warculture: How do you exist?
04:17:07Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Like what was your motivation? What happens at your life to came up with this?
04:18:01Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Did you know how ridiculous and childish your humour is for the majority of the people?
04:18:55Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
04:19:49Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: You just put a random name and think it's so funny, that this is the attention-grabber I am going to use. Even if you were bored. The fact that you used Penisfinger as a bit of fun here, says something about your personality.
04:20:43Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: woah what?
04:21:37Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Maybe you have psychosis. Probably you're too expensive to repair your mind, if even possible. See this feedback as me disdaining your flat Penisfinger joke.
Penisfingers: do i know you lenor
Lenor: Why do you think this is funny?
Lenor: You post it.
04:22:31Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: idk you
Lenor: This question is just distraction
Lenor: It really doesn't matter
Lenor: You're damaged and don't have counter-proof
Penisfingers: whats my other account name
Lenor: Otherwise. Why would you do that
04:23:25Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: I hope something mindful.
Penisfingers: it doesnt matter what my name is
Lenor: No. We never meet before. Proving that your memory is a bit bad at least.
04:24:19Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: you sound like a idiot
Lenor: Seriously this brand "Lenor" is an German advertising brand.
Lenor: Ok. Why do you think, that explaining publicly your name is funny?
04:25:13Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: my name is ridiculous
Lenor: Too ridiculous.
Lenor: Like childrish 
Penisfingers: thats the point
Lenor: Who find this funny?
Lenor: That point is pointless.
04:26:07Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: It isn't special.
Penisfingers: no one finds it funny 
Lenor: So you like being ridiculous?
Lenor: Even though it will have no effect in your social life and beyond?
Lenor: Even if is negative?
Penisfingers: i generally just logged in this account to fuck around
04:27:01Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Random name.
Lenor: I see. Can you get it that other people find your humour, low?
Penisfingers: no one else is agreeing with tou
04:27:55Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: And are you in a German-speaking county.
Lenor: ?
Penisfingers: possibly
Lenor: I agree that your joke is bad
Penisfingers: I love Hitler.
Lenor: Du hast sicher die Marke "Lenor" gesehen und dachtest es
Lenor: So not?
04:28:49Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: No German ever make jokes like this with the dark part of history 
Penisfingers: my ancestors are german
Lenor: Except you're a German-hated muslim?
Lenor: Oh
Lenor: Listen. Don't do those jokes about Nazis and ISIS
04:29:43Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: are you a mom
Lenor: Or any Islam sort. Be careful. Germany's society is sensitive nowadays 
Lenor: Do I act like a mom?
Penisfingers: Yes 
Lenor: Does a mom critizied your joke? 
04:30:37Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: ill show you something
Lenor: Well, I have to disappoint both of us. Appearantly m, I am too less of a dad.
Lenor: A virgin you may say
04:31:31Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: a virgin male
Lenor: No I am a male and disappointed of myself right now
Lenor: Yes
Lenor: Ok so let's agree
Lenor: I have too less testosterone 
04:32:25Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: And your joke is low that people think you're a Kevin
Lenor: Agree?
Penisfingers: are you my future self
Lenor: I am 21.
Lenor: So idk what you're unironically asking
Penisfingers: im 22
Lenor: Bruh
04:33:19Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Definitely no
Lenor: Anyways, your ridiculousness reduce your social status
04:34:13Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Except you're in a special group, no one like that Penisfinger joke
Lenor: It's too meta.
Penisfingers: you mean beta
Lenor: No. Meta. Basic
Lenor: You just refer your name
04:35:07Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Every YouTube-Reviewer see this as bad.
Penisfingers: ok lenin
Lenor: A flat joke. Critizied by the Fairly OddParents newest season.
Lenor: Now I am a leftist mom. -'a
04:36:00Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: -,-
Penisfingers: Dude get a life already.
Lenor: I already have one
Lenor: This is a part of it.
Lenor: Do I write like a female?
Penisfingers: yes you do
Lenor: Like if someone ask me
Lenor: Ok
04:36:54Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: And you don't know how a male would write?
Lenor: Or a non-binary if this explodes your mind?
Penisfingers: You can write whatever you want and how.
Lenor: But you said I write like a mom
Lenor: Like a female
04:37:49Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Penisfingers: Yes you do being senstive.
Lenor: And I at least want to act sometimes chad
Lenor: Ok
Lenor: Well... I think you wouldn't help me to write rough?
04:38:43Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: Thanks for the feedback anyways.
Lenor: I expected you to call me psychosis, this is also fine.
Penisfingers: This is a game you realize.
04:39:37Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: And what are you doing here?
Penisfingers: chilling
Lenor: There's actually a time where school kids join just in this lobby chat and talk random stuffs.
Penisfingers: yes there is they would tear you apart they hate people like you
Lenor: Yeah what's the point? You just read and write nothing?
04:40:31Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: That's why I am here now before they will came.
Lenor: Why would they hate me? Just being sensitive?
Lenor: I guess
Penisfingers: they mention being nazis and say nigger
04:41:25Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: They also want to ban people they are too creep.
Lenor: I mean, not all of them are racist and nazis. Right?
Penisfingers: Who knows its just is how it is.
Lenor: Well, this conversation is going pointless itself
04:42:19Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)
Lenor: We are both just nobodies in this endless universe
Lenor: Or... I at least
Penisfingers: then why start it
Lenor: Yet your Penis fingers joke is still lame for me
Lenor: I said it is going to be pointless
04:43:13Monday, March 7, 20220Sun: ↑ 06:20 ↓ 17:54 (11h 34m)

Penisfingers: me i stay up all night
Runikidz: youre german-american?
Penisfingers: nope im just american
Runikidz: with german anestors 25%?
Penisfingers: idk never took a test
Runikidz: ok
Runikidz: World War 2 was a great thing huh
Penisfingers: I mean wars always happen.
Runikidz: do you believe Hitler was a neutral evil or lawful evil in D&D?
Penisfingers: well he is evil he caused lots of things
Runikidz: and lawful or not?
Penisfingers: Killing is people isnt lawful.
Runikidz: but he was a statist
Penisfingers: he was a what?
Runikidz: he bans smoking and his econimocs were even center-auth-left
Runikidz: More goverment
Runikidz: and regulation
Penisfingers: idrc he is in hell
Runikidz: yeah thats why I was asking if hes lawful too?
Penisfingers: idk do you support him
Runikidz: just curious about placing Hitler in Dungueons&Dragons
Runikidz: idk actually
Penisfingers: you like my name?
Runikidz: idc
Penisfingers: i was just seeing who was on here
Runikidz: ok
Runikidz: in my alignment, Marxism-Leninism would be neutral evil
Runikidz: and I was placed between chaotic neutral and chaotic evil kind of
Dtrump: this my main account also
Runikidz: bruh
Runikidz: oh.. I ate the Pizza
Runikidz: just in case you remember
Dtrump: wdym?
Runikidz: wait a minute? Are you right-wing?
Runikidz: Dtrump"
Dtrump: I mainly supprt the right but I know the right wing has probelms.
Runikidz: whats your opinion on Hitler?
Runikidz: or what would a Dixie think of him in his perspective?
Dtrump: I dont have one. I never realized how many people support him still.
Runikidz: I mean it is also akwardly easy to answer this
Runikidz: Would Hitler kill me? Yes. -> Against Hitler.
Kneelessnightcat: Hitler would kill me so i hate him
Runikidz: But from a moral standpoint, as a aryan, he would be good for us
Runikidz: imagine being god and not caring about anything whats happen down there
Runikidz: like its egoistic to justify like this, isnt it?
Runikidz: maybe the Jews were like Covid and he just tries to rescue his people too
Runikidz: in his worldview
Kneelessnightcat: neat
Kneelessnightcat: ive got 23 answer cards and 6 question cards finished
Runikidz: noice
Runikidz: ok so this is my take: Lawful Neutral means obeying cultural laws according to easydamus.com so is ethno-nationalism. Communism aka M-Lenism is evil for being self-reliant and determined and the libertarian-left favors self-dependency in the D&D alignments
Runikidz: National Socialism were corporatist, so more in the economically auth-center with their production-ad-hoc-plans, bullying industries and price control flourishing the black market. So averging this out, NatSoc is a bit more Lawful Evil with their enviromental government laws.
Runikidz: so the lawful good character is a feudalist and the chaotic evil one Luxury Automated Communism according to this https://quark88.github.io/dozenvalues/?40.45,40.45,50.0,40.45,40.45,59.55 (you can change numbers lol) with the axial colleration to this http://filteries.com/politics
Runikidz: Even anarchist does genocide so every extremist is "evil" to your definition, but it is the left, who where self-thinking (libleft) and self-grabbing (authleft).
Runikidz: another useful link noone cares: http://www.easydamus.com/alignmentreal.html
Runikidz: so the greatest mistake Hitler did was denying free markets and being too extremist according to Dtrump´s definition, since no centrist or moderate ever advocate direct genocide as far as I know it
Abby420: heyyyy
Abby420: mom why are you on sooo soon
Runikidz: I heard that the US federal government also refuses Native Indians eating Buffalos, yet this is something an public-property-taker would do, denying resources-accesses, so they use extrem-auth-leftist weapons, Yes I can see though reality now, Morally.
Runikidz: let me guess, noone listens? Fine. I am going to build my own opinions myself
Abby420: ?
Runikidz: yes
Abby420: was reading still
Runikidz: I will do it and noones gonna stop me
Runikidz: take your time. It isnt for everyone
Runikidz: just saying that Richard Spencer get more hate than he deserved it
Runikidz: gets*
Abby420: oh yea 
Runikidz: like whats wrong with being aware of who we are and our history, our spirit?
Abby420: idk tbh
Runikidz: Even he acknowledges the atrocities, white people did. Every race does slavery and genocide and idk, just it appears that we white are very good at it, follow-up by the chineses
Runikidz: whites*
Runikidz: well, I am still watching his publication and he loves Texas. And any last words before I leave?
Abby420: TEXAS IS AMAZING 
Runikidz: See? This guy is Lawful Neutral at least in D&D, no evil, respecting societie´s laws
Runikidz: than bye

Azalanative: I like how we see ourself as a community of encouraged customers making our life and the world a bit better. Step-By-Step.
Azalanative: More and more poeple will join azala.com instead of Meta.
Generic: ?
Katlyn_sheeran: My name is Katlyn Sheeran and before the Biden presidency, I could talk with a lot of poeple outside. Now, the conditions force me to stay inside. I never understood Zoomer-Hipster-cultures, until I mett this site azala.info
Generic: WTF IS HAPPENING
Thephilliplines: So whta are you waiting. Join azala.info and meet your potential friend and soulmate from africa. Peace out.
