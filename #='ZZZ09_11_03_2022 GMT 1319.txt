Anon97: Whatever. Instead resolving the Ukraine conflict with this video hacking https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zEJCKf8xwbY, talking with extremist people to get their position or reforming this world into a better place where we can finally chill as the end of history, we just cycling into another pity drama and work-demanded consumerism taking our identity and bad iFunny memes prophesied to condemn hell. If you use Facebook and play the "game", you're fostering the problem with AI collecting your data.

Derpynugget0891: Did you have a dream you could work in space?
Get away from the rat race, immersed in nature?
If you long for better ways to earn your paycheck
Then come along to Halcyon, the worlds await ya
Danger, danger, got to make a good decision
You're faced with a range of available positions
So pick one quick and then take a trip to live in
This particular destination then begin to make a living
16:02:30Wednesday, March 9, 20220

Each occupation brings unique perks
Stop crewing groundbreaker, start moving earth
We've got locational vocations for your choosing, serf
Please allow a guy to clarify a few things first
You can skip past the small print, it's all confusing words
It's just a technicality that says you have to see the contract
Look! A technicolour TV, you really want that!
Derpynugget0891: So come on out to the outer worlds
There's ample opportunity so help yourself
A splash of colours really helps to sell
The promotional utopia surrounding hell, knock, knock

It's a Helter Skelter whirling round and filled
To the hilt with thrills, it's the outer worlds

Calling all you rejects, we can let you reset
Your standing in society and hide your creepy defects
We can't agree to higher fees, we'll hire you for peanuts
But why would we provide what you're not likely to need yet?
What good's a budget when you're fighting ugly creatures,
With the mouth-breathing features of your former DT teacher?
It's in the manual, standard operational procedure
Been there, done that, stole the bloody t-shirt
Derpynugget0891: We've stashed a lot of weapons
To bash somebody's head in
So be careful what you want
Because it could be what you're getting

Derpynugget0891: A little observation
You wish to rap but it is that's rhyming
You kind of seem like you'd be alright at mining
Life's hard but you're a shining diamond
Just sign the line here beside the hyphens
And I'll provide you unspoiled horizons
To heightened delight, leave minds enlightened
You'll find time for fine wine and dining
The highlights of high life or lying in
See the dollars signs? We are colonising the skies
Derpynugget0891: Follow the economy, it's gonna provide a sizeable
Income, just wait and see, but it isn't for the little man
The HHC's gonna take it and make him pay the fee
His salary's another technicality that we
Just have to seem as if we're carrying out the instructions
Till it's adjusted to account for some deductions
Derpynugget0891: We're packing stacks of ammo
Shred flesh and crack enamel
So be careful how you spend your cash
Or you might have to haggle

Hitting people with sticks or finer technicalities
You'll find a set of qualities to fit your partiality
Whatever your talent there's a planet to inhabit Here's an opportunity and all you've got to do is grab it Slaving all day, no vacation break or Sabbaths

So come on and give it a go, pal
But if you don't wanna, oh well
There's another dozen suckers up for working, no doubt
So shall we?
It's low salary but we don't need to save
These rates of fatalities are so great
That your mortality is a formality
The longer you stay healthy the more chance of a malady
Derpynugget0891: We're shilling medication
To make you better paying
Customers under sedation
Revamp work as recreation
Brainwashing as education
Lack of thought as meditation
Capital needs generation

Janmartenofficial: Derpy, you should compensate your desire to be liked by somewhere else. Generic, I heard contradictory stuff about your gender. Just look at what's between your legs or and your chromosomes (XX or XY as female) and have a definite answer to your bio
17:10:55Wednesday, March 9, 20220
Derpynugget0891: jan there is no need to be an asshole
Derpynugget0891: just because i rickrolled you doesn't mean you need to be salty

Janmartenofficial: You suggests me links idc without asking a bit what I want. Also I have places attend to.
Derpynugget0891: also stop making fun of the gender of someone you have never met it doesn't make you a likeable person
17:12:55Wednesday, March 9, 20220
Janmartenofficial: There's only two sexes and everything beyond is revolutionary or roleplay
Derpynugget0891: do you know how to get the concept of a joke into your thick empty ass skull
Derpynugget0891: even then you still shouldn't make fun of people for it asshole

17:16:56Wednesday, March 9, 20220
Janmartenofficial: Before 1960s and still in worlds majority population there's only two sexes recognized 
Derpynugget0891: especially when you sit in your basement and feel like your superior to everyone else
Derpynugget0891: nobody cares
Ima: ello

Janmartenofficial: Ok let's test it? Is there even a consensus about Derpys link and Generics gender?
Derpynugget0891: hey*

Ima: It doesnt hurt

Catgirlwithtea: LOOOGGAAANNNN
Ima: TEAAAAAAA
Catgirlwithtea: IIMMMMAAAA
Catgirlwithtea: :3
Ima: TEAAAAaa HRUUU?
Logan15: owo
Mastacheeks: dam when i gtg tea gets on
Catgirlwithtea: huehuheueheue
Xmasjizzy: My moral problem is, why should we provide someone who doesn't even want to life?
Ima: thats what i tell people 
Ima: if i dont wanna live why waste the air on me? theres no point. just a waste of space. 
Xmasjizzy: So can we as society just leave you in the woods?
Ima: yes.
Catgirlwithtea: yes
Catgirlwithtea: i will happily burn you too
Logan15: yes
Ima: matter of fact i live near/in woods.
Soup50: balls
Logan15: same ima
Xmasjizzy: cum
Catgirlwithtea: cock
Ima: i surrounded by mountains, it works  
Catgirlwithtea: same ima
Soup50: I live next to my school
Logan15: i dont live near mountains ohio not that pretty
Ima: nah my state has pretty mountains and water falls
Xmasjizzy: The only thing stopping you from ky is... You imagine dying in a ocean with your friend (idk how consent it is for him)?
Ima: i only worry about 2 people. 
Xmasjizzy: A "perfect" suicide way?
Catgirlwithtea: sure
Soup50:  I live on an island
Soup50: It is very long
Logan15: cuba?
Soup50: no
Soup50: It is very long
Xmasjizzy: I mean, kitchen knifes existing and you can skip many parts of this game called life cough
Logan15: brb
Ima: if they leave me theres no worry at all, and i have thought about the "perfect suicide" 
Ima: i could only think of two. 
Soup50: deez nuts
Xmasjizzy: Which seems more wasteful for me but no one can stop yiu
Specialspirit: hello
Soup50: hello
Xmasjizzy: Like those CO2-footprint by just flying above the ocean off
Specialspirit: yoo soup wats poppin
Soup50: Brand new whip just hopped in
Specialspirit: damnnnn
Xmasjizzy: And... You die, no matter how you do it
Ima: well, why not die happily? peacefully? i live near newyork. the thought of jumping off a building on a cloudy pretty night, after watching the sunset. or fire works? 
Ima: it seems nice.
Logan15: back
Catgirlwithtea: mhmm
Ima: only a 3 hour drive. 
Specialspirit: why are we talking about suicide
Soup50: idk
Xmasjizzy: Why does it matter? If you die, you can't feel or remember anything 
Logan15: no idea
Xmasjizzy: Like... Just do it, if you want to of course
Soup50: ok bye
Logan15: bye
Specialspirit: live a life thats worth living, dont end it too soon
Catgirlwithtea: bye soup
Specialspirit: bye soup
Jacob_rees_mogg: oh c'mon, at least jump in front of the subway to inconvenience a maximum number of people
Ima: i dont know. I find it calming, just a feeling of peace watching sunsets/ the sky. and that being the last thing i see seems peacful.
Xmasjizzy: I think it's too late and high cost to save Ima
Catgirlwithtea: you know no one is gonna take you serious right, special?
Specialspirit: yeah
Ima: LMAO
Logan15: lol
Specialspirit: they like waaay too edgy
Ima: nope
Xmasjizzy: Id even notice what spirit wrotes until you said it. Idc
Catgirlwithtea: everyone's that way; at least once, but, those stupid motivational letters or whatever dont help; so i say dont bother.
Specialspirit: than what do you call it? (probably suicidal)
Ima: honestly my health is shit. id rather die how i want to than die in a hospital.
Logan15: whisper if you need me
Catgirlwithtea: just let them jump off from whence they want
Specialspirit: well we all die of course. but go down being someone everyone remembers
Ima: more peacful than beeps, doctors, and hospital bills i cant pay for.
Specialspirit: theres a special spirit life tip
Xmasjizzy: Theres no peace if your mom cries
Jacob_rees_mogg: special means don't go out alone, take as many with you as possible  ;)
Jacob_rees_mogg: and do max property damage
Catgirlwithtea: -_-
Catgirlwithtea: and killl some ppl
Catgirlwithtea: :3
Specialspirit: thats why i wanna die in a plane
Xmasjizzy: Wut? Sorry no one takes me alive
Specialspirit: :)
Ima: terrorism? im arab and german. its a deadly combo. 
Catgirlwithtea: ahhaha
Catgirlwithtea: yeah
Xmasjizzy: For a suicidal person you act confident. A weird world to be livin
Ima: Special im a terrorist, just let me know which plane you get on ;)
Catgirlwithtea: hheuheue
Specialspirit: dont just jump off a building, do something amazing before you go like visit Niagara Falls
Specialspirit: do something you wouldnt normally do
Catgirlwithtea: nah, special, just let them fall
Ima: nope. im goin gto japan and meeting my one friend before i go
Specialspirit: nice
Jacob_rees_mogg: before you go to the forest?
Logan15: my brain hurts
Catgirlwithtea: indeed
Xmasjizzy: Nice co2 and oil waste there before jumping tonthe ocean *clap ^clap*
Jacob_rees_mogg: It's probably early stage brain cancer @Logan
Specialspirit: also suicide is kind of a sin so like no thanks, ill just die of old age.
Catgirlwithtea: 'tonthe'
Jacob_rees_mogg: mine feels like its exploding all the time
Ima: sin?
Ima: Special im gay.
Catgirlwithtea: so what? the devil takes you instead of tgod?
Specialspirit: oh fuck
Specialspirit: uhhhhh
Ima: i dont think god is going to focus on me being suicidal 
Specialspirit: yeah good point
Ima: also i dont believe in heaven or hell.
Ima: this world is already both.
Jacob_rees_mogg: that certainly makes suicide a lot easier
Ima: we just stay here, i think our spirts float around. 
12:12:02Thursday, March 10, 20220
Logan15: cool i wont say shit about that ima because ik itll start shit
Specialspirit: if i didnt believe in heaven or hell i would be scared and sad
Xmasjizzy: Many people may look me as an asshole but think about it, Imas parents raise them, the welfare state gave them money maybe, economy investing in every of us (I think), God gave you the privilege to act on earth, some poor people fight for it and you just... Throw it away for asthetic?
Ima: logan i dont care about religion. believe what you want, it your life so live it how you want.
Jacob_rees_mogg: Why? It would take away all responsiblity after your death?
12:13:02Thursday, March 10, 20220
Logan15: cool i wont say shit about that ima because ik itll start shit
Specialspirit: if i didnt believe in heaven or hell i would be scared and sad

Ima: logan i dont care about religion. believe what you want, it your life so live it how you want.
Jacob_rees_mogg: Why? It would take away all responsiblity after your death?
Gamerzrayus: 7c
Ima: i dont start shit over religion, its so stupid. 
Xmasjizzy: Excatly 
12:13:26Thursday, March 10, 20220
Specialspirit: yeah same
12:13:40Thursday, March 10, 20220
Logan15: ok
Jacob_rees_mogg: Believing there is nothing after death should very comforting. It means nothing matters in the long run.
Specialspirit: i dont hate people for believing a certain way. thats sin too.
Ima: exactly. 
Ima: Jacob, i think thats why im so comfortable with death.
Xmasjizzy: because you think it's a sin?
12:14:40Thursday, March 10, 20220
Ima: no
Ima: thats there is nothing after death
Specialspirit: eh if you believed in a afterlife its not like anything you did matters still.
Catgirlwithtea: @Special how come?
Xmasjizzy: Why are you afraid and yet desire nothing?
Koda: stfu
Koda: cringe.
Ima: just your spirts floating around after its been through so much. its like it finally gets to rest.
Koda: both of you cringe ass mfs
Catgirlwithtea: KODAA FUCKING FINALLY YOU'RE HERE TO DEAL WITH THESE NEW JACKASSES
12:15:41Thursday, March 10, 20220
Logan15: ofc kodas here to talk shit
Specialspirit: see koda is a example. he is judging opinions. nobody likes him.
Xmasjizzy: Just search a job and a husband and than it feels better to continue life than an epic goodbye
Ima: HI KODA
Koda: i dont even like new people
Catgirlwithtea: ^^^^
Catgirlwithtea: same here

Koda: yes.
Specialspirit: aw how
Catgirlwithtea: ive been checking every single one of them in fear they might be nightmare; none of them are him
Logan15: very
Xmasjizzy: I guess it's cringe nowadays to suggest a young suicidal girl to find her love of the live to replace her desire to destroy herself -,-
Specialspirit: HOW?
Specialspirit: :(
12:17:41Thursday, March 10, 20220
Koda: yeah its cringe.
Koda: idk
Catgirlwithtea: ^^
Koda: idk ig you're not annoying i've only been here like 5 mins
Koda: but i'm sure you will be.
Xmasjizzy: Calm down Spirit. That's exactly what they want to make you. Hate creates hate
Catgirlwithtea: they are annoying; tbh
Logan15: ^
Specialspirit: yeah you right xmas
Koda: then just ignore them lmao
Xmasjizzy: It's just two new people lol
Catgirlwithtea: talking about suicide prevention when all that really needs to happen is just, letting it happen
Koda: new people are annoying.
12:18:42Thursday, March 10, 20220
Jacob_rees_mogg: Why do I feel new people is a stab at me despite being here intermittently since early 2020 :(
Catgirlwithtea: you cant help them anywayy
Specialspirit: koda and logan could just be alts
Logan15: nope
Xmasjizzy: Ok next time we encourage her 👍

Jacob_rees_mogg: I still have no idea who xmas is, because apparently I have them ignored under another alt
12:46:50Thursday, March 10, 20220
Xmasjizzy: Ah wait... We should protect the children as an obligation of society
Xmasjizzy: But kids can be weird that's fine
Mastacheeks: and now Xmas will admit it, ask for forgiveness, then with that sympathy he'll prob wisper someone...get them into a "trap" and controll them while saying "im not a pedo"
Catgirlwithtea: that is fine
Catgirlwithtea: weirdos are fine
Koda: yes, kids can be weird around kids
Mastacheeks: ^
Xmasjizzy: Instead just staying out of porn nooo they have to know better 
Catgirlwithtea: but young and old pedos arent
Koda: what does any of this have to do with porn?
Xmasjizzy: Not only pedos are weird
Koda: nobody said anything about porn

Good_girl: What?!
Logan15: i dont care if youre gay as long as im not part of it if youre a guy and start hitting on me then we're gonna ave problems

Leviathan1882: BUt not just for gay people, but for many things, 
Koda: and you ADMITTED to being a homophobe
Leviathan1882: But*
Koda: idgaf about how you feel now
Confederatelel: Back them it was the negro without the concept of free will, nowadays it's the robots and the child workers in Bangladesh 
Koda: you gonna explain the racist part to?
Logan15: koda i dont wanna start shit with you again
Koda: cause you lose.
Koda: everytime.
13:22:37Thursday, March 10, 20220

Mastacheeks: we know
Koda: WE KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.
Koda: THERES ONLY TWO
Mastacheeks: but if we start to wisper yall get the wrong ideas
Confederatelel: They can ignore me, but the truth preveals, that there's a natural hierarchy. Discrimination is a reflex towards people being different from your In-Group.
Callmecali: wth-
Leviathan1882: To tell people who they are talking to so there isnt any confussion,
Leviathan1882: And Hi,
Jacob_rees_mogg: Unless you have nobody ignored, you can never be sure @Koda

Koda: yup.
Confederatelel: Only repeating words of the winners?
Logan15: and i havent said anything racist in months

Koda: god damn all the worst people are on today
13:31:39Thursday, March 10, 20220
Leviathan1882: AI usually gets aware when its programed to be aware, and therefore, isnt aware, its still following its program,
Callmecali: including u deadass 
Callmecali: x-x
Confederatelel: He drives home by sitting of the bus. Society expect the bus to carry on, therefore his bus is a slave of humans.

Logan15: yeah cap
Maple_boy: huh?
Callmecali: caps probs dead
13:33:40Thursday, March 10, 20220
Confederatelel: What is out of context? That humans are biological robots and the blacks doesn't care enough otherwise they would freed or die themself instead being slaved.
Catgirlwithtea: probably
Logan15: Maple_boy: hey logan and landon
Catgirlwithtea: that and izzy
Logan15: you needed us
Leviathan1882: Nah,

Mastacheeks: ...

Koda: and then later it says he couldnt do something
Specialspirit: wish it stayed that way anon95
Koda: “… with God all things are possible.” — Matthew 19:26

“…The LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.”“… with God all things are possible.” — Matthew 19:26

“…The LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.”

Anon95: actually I am not religious but sometimes I have a feel, but in general I am lacking of it
Koda: ok i also have a question
Koda: what was the point of god making putin?
Generic: if the biblical god is true, then he should understand the simple human logic he instilled in us that makes us doubt him :\
Anon95: that just write this question instead of the announcment of a question in a chat
Specialspirit: you cant change my mind anyway because i learned it when i was a baby
Koda: because like

Koda: so like..
Koda: god an opp.
Anon95: idk who god is. I never saw them

Specialspirit: the human logic came when the devil tempted adam and eve to eat a fruit
Generic: LMAOOOOO
Koda: my boy
Koda: god was made like thousands of years ago
Specialspirit: when they ate the fruit they saw reality just a theory tho
Generic: humans wouldnt have even been around back then :\
Koda: and other than writing in a book
Koda: there is NO proof of him.
Generic: and the land woulda been uninhabitable 
Anon95: maybe theres two gods or one schizophrenic one?
Generic: we woulda still been retarded ass bacteria floating in water
Specialspirit: because when they ate the fruit they realized they were naked 
Koda: how did adam and eve even reproduce?
Anon95: like... noone understands gods will or something
Koda: if adam and eve had a baby
Anon95: dick vagina
Specialspirit: yeah duh
Koda: doesnt that mean one of them wouldve had to fuck their baby
Anon95: is this even a question
Koda: to keep it going?
Koda: like if they only had one kid
Specialspirit: they sinned when they lied to god
Koda: and lets say it was a girl
Anon95: maybe god spawned more ?
Koda: then that means adam would have to fuck his daughter
Koda: to get HER pregnant
Generic: ok may i end this argument rn?
Koda: so SHE could make more.
Anon95: he has Eve dude
Specialspirit: no they had 4 kids dumbass
Anon95: why the daughter?
Jacob_rees_mogg: you can try gen, but I don't see it happening

Anon95: Sinhala script, also known as Sinhalese script, is a writing system used by the Sinhalese people and most Sri Lankans in Sri Lanka and elsewhere to write the Sinhala language, as well as the liturgical languages, Pali and Sanskrit. The Sinhalese Akṣara Mālāva, one of the Brahmic scripts, is a descendant of the Ancient Indian Brahmi script. It is also related to ancient Kannada script.

Anon95: The Sinhala
letter ඞ (U+0D9E) traditionally denotes the nasal in the first (velar) group of consonants, corresponding to Devanagari ङ and Tamil ங. It’s transliterated as “ṅ” in IAST
Anon95: 
or “ng” informally.

That said, when you encounter ඞ in modern texts, it is almost always a typo: someone accidentally typed ඞ (U+0D9E) when they really meant to write ඩ (U+0DA9). E.g. you can find occurrences of කැඞී in Wikipedia

Geb: Okay think of it with this analogy

If you want to kill people, you're a psychopath. However, most murders are not committed by psychopaths.

Here, the murderer is a metaphor for child molesters, the ones who commit the crime, while the psychopaths are the pedophiles, the one that think about doing it
