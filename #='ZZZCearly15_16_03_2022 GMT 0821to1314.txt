Koda: no cause your point is dumb as fuck.
Hellenist: I never said that only one side. But both sides
Koda: like what point are you trying to get across? pedophilia is okay?
Hellenist: Ok so if girl X seduce an adult, who's fault?
Ima: adult.
Hellenist: There's something called traps
Koda: the adult dumbass
Koda: he can just ignore the girl
Koda: it's a fucking child
Hellenist: Not their parents too?
Koda: no.
Ima: they're an adult. they can tell them that's not okay.
Koda: fr
Ima: they dont have to have sex with a minor. 
Ima: they're smart enough.
Hellenist: With age of 11 you can think abstractly and there's also bad teenagers
Koda: and stop changing your accounts you 20 year old bum.

Koda: okay so you're saying that if
Koda: someone killed their suicidal friend
Hellenist: Both sides?
Koda: that's okay?
Ima: theres a difference between 17 and 18, and 18 and 13.
Ima: see how thats more wrong?
Hellenist: Well suciding is also sin because you killed someone mainly yourself
