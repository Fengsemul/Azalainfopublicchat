Snek04: Originally designed as an inexpensive and dependable way to provide clean drinking water for developing countries, the LifeStraw filters out 99.9% of all bacteria and protozoa found in lakes, streams, or rivers. As its name implies, the device operates much like a straw, allowing users to safely drink directly from any source of water that is available. Because it is effective, inexpensive (just $20), weighs just two ounces, and can filter up to 1000 liters
Specialspirit: i dont have a straw tho
Snek04: You don't have 20$ and Internet access?
10:50:53Tuesday, March 29, 2022Piano Day
