Generic: not that topic.
Ima: May i ask why you began to have that conversation with me?
Kay_loverttv: I lost so many people
Ima: I have too
Kay_loverttv: You can live your life as always
Ima: however
Kay_loverttv: its so easy to say that
Kay_loverttv: What if your brother tries to kill himself
Ima: id kill myself. I know he's the only one who'd be deeply affected. thats why im not.
Kay_loverttv: But youre still dreaming and say that your health is bad
Ima: my health is bad.
Jacob_rees_mogg: so let's play a game, not word association given how vulnerable ima has already been made to feel
Kay_loverttv: Are you sure its that bad. Or projecting?
Jacob_rees_mogg: maybe chain story telling? everyone contributes one word at a time
Kay_loverttv: Blockchain
Ima: i have cancer, im sick, some other shit from genes my mother gave me, breathing issues, and more shit
Generic: y do yall think.
Generic: just do.
Ima: Im sorry
Kay_loverttv: and yet she survives and gave you birth. Curious
Kay_loverttv: And your bro
Ima: wdym i know she survives but her health isnt great either.
Kay_loverttv: I was at a game and they kicked me. End.
Kay_loverttv: over 20
Generic: i was at ur moms house and got good neck
Kay_loverttv: or wait till nature takes you idk at this point
Generic: End.
Ima: thats what im going to do, see you mentioned knwoing my dreams, did you ever know how I said I would?
Kay_loverttv: I was gay and then I saw boobs in the first time. End
Jacob_rees_mogg: who you even talking to boi
Generic: i wanna be the reason lesbians hate dick. End>
Kay_loverttv: Its chaotic to scramble what youre actually thinking
Kay_loverttv: I am god. End.
Ima: im waiting for the day my doctor finally says there's nothing to do, and that im dying. ill go watcha sunset at a cliff and jump off. simple as that. 
Ima: ill be dead, and wouldve been dying anyway
Kay_loverttv: ok thats easy put
Kay_loverttv: #metoo
Ima: just rather die peacfully not in a hospital bed
Ima: see?
Ima: not so bad
Generic: i am a faggot. End.
Kay_loverttv: Does that matter? For you yes
Kay_loverttv: E. End.
Kay_loverttv: Winning is like sugar. Temporary tasty. Than you want more
Generic: i raped a pregnant bitch and told my friends i had a threesome. End.
Kay_loverttv: In this case, you want to lose in a certain way
Ima: yes.
Kay_loverttv: Generic in chat told me: i raped a pregnant bitch and told my friends i had a threesome. End.
Ima: either way i'd lose, why not lose happily?
Kay_loverttv: but whats the point when its all over and you cant feel anything and they still mssed you a bit. Just be honest by yourself
Kay_loverttv: Because it doesnt matter
Kay_loverttv: Youre delaying the inevintable
Ima: tell me, if you were dying in a hospital, would you die there, or go die peacfully, how you wanted to
Kay_loverttv: bad english
Kay_loverttv: God and nature decides
Kay_loverttv: Having an opinion is toxic
Generic: i literally jus said that
Ima: then im toxic.
Generic: good observation

Generic: *has no idea wut ur on abt*
Kay_loverttv: ok. If you can afford a hospital and painless pills
Ima: i cant.
Ima: hospitals are expensive. 
Kay_loverttv: Story chain till someone breaks
Ima: thats why I want to die happil
Kay_loverttv: You want but you cant and it doesnt worth the experience you got
Generic: im not familiar with story chains
Kay_loverttv: my opinion
Generic: is this a european thing?
Kay_loverttv: me neither but I am adoptive
Kay_loverttv: I create situations where I win
Ima: we both have our opinions, i never said i would rn. i have goals in life, i just said i wanted to just die peacefully. 
Kay_loverttv: oh
Kay_loverttv: So you arent that depressed or some similar

Ima: i dont know either.
Ima: I dont know why I need to explain myself to you.
Kay_loverttv: So no sucide push-thoughts?
Ima: why keep pushing it, I don't want to talk about it to you.
Ima: It makes me uncomfortable. 
Kay_loverttv: Theres so much in life, you cant have it back
Ima: Please leave me alone
Kay_loverttv: I... well .. your choice
Ima: cant be mad when your pushing a child to talk bout their shit.
Kay_loverttv: I am mad because you somehow want to considwer this
Generic: ig.
