Koda: such a fucking loser x-x
Badge: Koda chill
Ima: Landon010: I have ruined my life... At least on here; this is probably going to be a farewell letter to all of you. I've made many mistakes in my life since October, such as whispering the lotham word... "Hey" to Ima. I met up with some bad ppl, they did stupid shit, then Callmelili and Koda came along.
Ima: Landon010: I am not here to put blame on anyone bc that is the last thing I want ya'll to do before I go. Ya'll were some great friends, even though i broke your trust in the very end. You all are great people, I trust ya'll to the very end. In my time of three and a half years ive had fuck up's, and repairs. This time i don't think I can repair. I've become Koda's punching bag, Ima's now "Uncomfy friend that she regrets showing her face to," Now even she hates me.
20:09:10Friday, April 29, 2022Dance Day
Ima: Koda: lmaoooooooo
Koda: bro said ruined his LIFE
Landon010: I got into a fight with Jacob today resulting in our deletion of our GC. Tallguy, you should be proud of yourself; you were able to see Ima's face in a single night to where as for me it took a whole 2 months, guess you are a real charmer. Badge, idk much about you, but you were one hell of a neutral friend. Tea, I've fucked up our friendship somehow by saying "hey"x2 which I'm sorry if I didn't give you the time to explain it to me.
Koda: no, because i alreayd know he's going to come back and try to do some attention-seeking acceptance shit.
Koda: probably going to come in and say something like
Ima: Koda: okay, this has officially become cringe.
ILandon010: Koda... I really don't like you but you seem better than I am to Ima, plz dont try to get in her pants. Callmelili, if you see this turn from your ways in which shit has occurred.
Koda: bro said he ruined his LIFE on here.
Koda: dude is 16, this is sad asf.
Landon010: yea fuck u to bro, fuck u to
Koda: nobody gives a fuck about your apology dude
Ima: what
Koda: or whatever it is
Badge: Was I online then? 
Ima: Koda: if its you saying you're leaving, ok bye have fun
Koda: probably better for you lmao
IKoda: bro fr left to write paragraphs that nobody is gonna really read x-x
Koda: get your mans lmao, but whatever you do, DO NOT TAKE HIM BACK AS A FRIEND OR SOME SHIT LIKE THAT
Koda: istg if you do some dumb shit like that-
Dtrump: no ones giving you sympathy or whatever you are looking o
Koda: fr
Koda: attention seeking ass mf
Koda: it's an online card game bro
Koda: it's not that fucking deep lmao
Koda: "guys im so sorry, i havent been myself lately, all my friends irl have been dying and ive been suicidal ;("
20:10:16Friday, April 29, 2022Dance Day

The voice in my head got too persuasive
The flu contagious
Everybody dead except a couple rich white dudes in spaceships
Ding, ding, time is up, the world is ending, the climate sucks
I'm high and drunk, drivin' a Cybertruck
The AI talkin' to me like it's tryna fuck 
Soup50: Such a good boy when I was 18

Dtrump: She laced the cookies?
Limabean: hush

00:17:42Tuesday, May 3, 2022Constitution Day (Poland)

Limabean: mhm
