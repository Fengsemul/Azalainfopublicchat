Prit: Banging your wife last night wasn't enough, you have to bang our heads too
Prit: btw if she comes back, snatching me and I am silent, that means she won debate because apparently you can only have a life outside or sticking all night in chat and losing your sanity. Also best work contract to have to being busy in saturday night too. Your boss must be very proud of you. Or another excuse to leave chat from your insecurity?

Lightassassin: Those two chads with few others maybe always brought life in this place
Lightassassin: But now... I should have known better what a world would be without those two
Lightassassin: a more empty one
11:52:27Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Lightassassin: Even though Soup and Koda says "shut up" to me, it gives me some purpose to writing things compare to this dead place now
Lightassassin: Idk if somebody is even there
Lightassassin: Babyowo was right. I should do something more useful in my young than sticking in azala.info chat
Lightassassin: All of those ppl are gone
11:54:54Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Lightassassin: I mean they're alive but what if... naah. I make too much worries.
Darkriker: why did u kick me
Lightassassin: After all, the majority of the United States are alive and mortality rate is modern low
Lightassassin: Darkriker. The game owner has their own chat channel
Lightassassin: that "server" you got kicked. Your message is seperated
11:57:21Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Lightassassin: "There's two things in universe: Stupidity and the infinite space, but by the second, I am not sure." - Albert Einstein
Lightassassin: And yes Darkriker, applying the same method (mainly joining a server) and expecting different results is stupid (that you can resist that ban). It's the third time also  wanting to call game racist if it wasn't for Koda saying about a game code
Lightassassin: So two times racist and I bet it will be your third time too since you're learn-resistant or idk just walked away after being kicked
Limabean: what happened to soup and koda?
Lightassassin: Idk rlly
Lightassassin: He said he's in street and about drugs?
Lightassassin: Koda I think just sees this place so dead that he lost motivation
Lightassassin: So much to Social Justice
Lightassassin: with ppl keep spawning 
Limabean: oh
Lightassassin:  He got kicked out and has no money after lacking and buying Internet access?
Lightassassin: Yet what I get lost is that he has school chromebook for writing here
Limabean: I Know what happened
Limabean: When was he on tho?
Lightassassin: I didn't saw him yet
Lightassassin: middle in the day yesterday 
Limabean: ah

Lightassassin: He's hungry and have no money?

Lightassassin: got kicked out
Lightassassin: And after Generic wanting to abandon this game and Koda losing motivation too, I feel for their ban victims
Maple_boy: huh?
Lightassassin: The United States Of America, what a fun place to be
Lightassassin: well you know, some ppl got scared off

12:24:10Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Lightassassin: lalala the banned victims would have a better situation and reputation if it was for forgiveness instead of winning a debate to that point that it hurts them for real life (or social media since they're intertwined nowadays) lelele
Lightassassin: lalalal since you lurkers are so neutral at everything and can block me every time, your mouth is too big to decide what is my business and what's not leleel
12:26:37Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Lightassassin: Lalala Soup grabs IPs and Koda bullies them away, half of them pointing their fingers of others and I can only watch like you. Accepting that in you country, the US president smiling at the KKK leader and calling death penalty to 5 black teens with 1 fingerprint and a white person admitting he does the crime and protested in Central Park Trial, is still just "partially racist" lelele
12:29:04Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Lightassassin: lalala he even hates Lincoln even though he brought unity and freed their grand-grandparents, but hey, I am just mentally ill and you all know it better. Saying nigger as a white person is more racist than supporting affirmative action and Trump. Gg American ppl lelele
Limabean: SHut up 
Limabean: dam n
Limabean: the fuck?
Lightassassin: k I talked from topic away. Yet who gets offended by that is too childrish 
Lightassassin: I lost motivation too being here. If I had more balls I would face Soup and Koda. But my weakness overtook me
12:31:30Sunday, June 5, 2022World Environment Day
Maple_boy: no body cares now please shut up
Lightassassin: Generic as far as I heard is just Kodas commuted gf and Koda himself a teen. So Soup seems to be the head of all of this. (In their logic at least)
Lightassassin: I care :(
Lightassassin: And I try to reach ppl
Maple_boy: we dont want to hear you rant about your problems so please stop
Lightassassin: If you wouldn't care, why reading it a bit
Lightassassin: It's our problems 
Lightassassin: At least more than you think
Lightassassin: This "terrorization"
Lightassassin: And yet I got Stockholm-syndrome a bit. Humans are weird
