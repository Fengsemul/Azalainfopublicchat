Uternut: Mongols 14th century: I am gonna rape you.                                        also Mongols: I see you're a man of culture aswell. ☕️
Polchan: Even they sensed.... a bigger, blacker father
Izzy_blight: Can I get raped too
Polchan: so they have to respect their sons
Polchan: no
Uternut: We don't talk about child abuse in late middle ages
Izzy_blight: I wanna get raped by a big hairy pedophile
Polchan: It's "Child Use" for the pope and therefore God somehow
Polchan: oof
Slipknot: well I wish both of you good luck
Izzy_blight: Good luck with your dad mate
Slipknot: You had me at Good luck
Izzy_blight: Good duck 🦆 👍
Polchan: Schroedingers age: it's both too old to sustain and too young to fit in
Slipknot: SuS tain
Izzy_blight: AMONG us 
Slipknot: but fr old ppl in Sims 4 get a heart rate so fast during Woo-Hoo
Polchan: Dick-stabbing instead knife stabbing lol
Izzy_blight: Old men dying of sex
Polchan: And that's ... no ... It's just ninjas cutting the onions
Slipknot: Mahma, Pahpa. I don't wanna be as ugly as you
Slipknot: Dad: You will join the dark force and become a boomer for the next gen
Slipknot: me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Izzy_blight: No one is ugly. Everyone is beautiful in their own way
Izzy_blight: Except Steve Buscemi 
Slipknot: That's just an excuse for ugly ppl who doesn't care how much gfs they have
Polchan: Yeah that's the point. You don't care how others think of you
Slipknot: But than some 14-year-olds with their hoverboards will bully and picking on me, saying too slow and steal my wallet because I am probably alone walking to Aal-Mart
Polchan: r/oddlyspecific
Izzy_blight: My Chemical Romance 🌹
Slipknot: There's reasons for the youth hating, ask my grandpa how they serve him after fighting the war
Polchan: See it optimistic
Polchan: You can relax instead going to work
Slipknot: With enough money before you go poor. And this time your parents died earlier than you and you're childless 
Polchan: again
Polchan: r/oddlyspecific 
Izzy_blight: Motherless children 😂
Polchan: Although marrying and true love sucks
Polchan: Lol
Polchan: It's like brainwashing. You can't play video games when your gf wants you to waste money for looking pretty
Slipknot: fatherless
Slipknot: Also gurls have higher standards for beauty. So of course there's a gender gap
Polchan: I think it's because they're more pregnant and therefore and now it comes...
Polchan: Work less hours than man in life with regeneration too
Slipknot: Differ between then and than
Izzy_blight: Love is a meaningless farce. Just pay for sex and skip the rest
Slipknot: based
Vanillaicecream: It has meaning, but it's too less worth to achieve
Polchan: The "pink tax"
Izzy_blight: It's just gonna be taken from you one day even if you achieve it
Slipknot: I guess there's reasons why female products are more expensive 
Vanillaaicecream: true 😞
Vanillaicecream: Sus
Vanillaicecream: But I agree with
Slipknot: lol
Slipknot: Is this Among Us?
Izzy_blight: Yes. Impostre
Izzy_blight: Impsoster
Polchan: Impostre*
Izzy_blight: Jimposter
Vanillaicecream: I am too old for this
Vanillaicecream: I better leave the chat before I get leaked too
Slipknot: Lol it isn't that bad
Polchan: He's right. You don't even have to call the Pizza
Izzy_blight: Call spaghetti instead
Slipknot: The sick thing is, you can swat from an entire continent
Slipknot: Like if you have an Hawaiian guy and call though South Africa an Hawaiian Ananas pizza
Slipknot: And they say they don't 
Polchan: #FreeEpstein
Slipknot: I have bad news to tell you

Bicyclecare: The centrist media like Reuters try Ukraine to be against russia and this is just a syntome of it. They will create a One-World-Government (New World Order). after every enemy from USA is gone, noone can stop the elite. think about it, Ukraine was soo pro-russian before, and now all of the sudden since 2014 not? theres doubts that it was the CIA doing a false-flag as always

Izzy_blight: Cause life sucks 👌
Krzysia: Globally 800,000 people die from suicide every year – that’s twice the number from homicide.
Izzy_blight: Tragic
Izzy_blight: Hopefully they're at least at peace now
Krzysia: 1994 was the highest sucide year actually
Izzy_blight: Damn, 94 must have been rough
Krzysia: who knows since the stats don´t reveal the middle ages
Krzysia: syria also has the lowest, meanwhile Greenland the highest
Krzysia: It´s not all green and nice there
Izzy_blight: Greenland is a much worse place than I figured
Izzy_blight: We should burn it
Krzysia: But then ocean rises, but at least the Inuits have a warm place
Krzysia: Also did you know bout the civil war in syria. Greenland is better
Krzysia: it can be argue that all the ppl who want to kill themself, already died from it

Izzy_blight: I guess it was pretty depressing huh
Krzysia: peak of 30.3 per 100 000 by 1905. Rates then decreased to 21 per 100 000 in 1917 (during World War I), increasing to reach a second peak of 30.3 per 100 000 in 1934

Two2ducks: where are you from?

Two2ducks: here salads usually contain sour cream which raises the ingredient price nicely

Oreo27: Russianmt-lblimitedvisionmine
4doorsmorewhores16: Youre drunk
Dtrump: this site has bugs
Oreo27: lol
Oreo27: I was the last host
Oreo27: as another of my comrade left and skipped questions against Kill_all_fags
Oreo27: because he removed decks as host and, idk it was a stupid reaction
Oreo27: anyways I was the last player with him and than he added mine
Oreo27: or I was host  and he added it for me idk
Oreo27: than as I clicked Show Image, its deleted
Oreo27: liek almost a creepypasta
Oreo27: He was silent the entire time
Izzy_blight: Creppy
Izzy_blight: Spoopy
Oreo27: meanwhile we, the boys, just occupied this game and ask him why
Oreo27: than we ran out of ideas
Oreo27: and yeah now hes offline
Oreo27: but ask Tommy if you dont believe me
Chantal73: Tommyexthegamer16 n the "Funny" game
Oreo27: yes
Izzy_blight: Close encounters of the homophobic kind
Oreo27: actually it was more personal but I guess it overlaps too
4doorsmorewhores16: like that one Trump supporter who spits hot coffee on you and using his opposite political position to trigger him
4doorsmorewhores16: sry
Izzy_blight: Trump is the head of the illuminati
4doorsmorewhores16: I bet Jbiden got bullied out of this game

Oreo27: so
Oreo27: and now to teh conclusion
Izzy_blight: So basically im monky
Oreo27: Kill_all_fags hacks
Generic: listen to the beat dammit
Oreo27: i am white
Oreo27: He deleted a card from  my Russianmt-lblimitedvisionmine
Oreo27: somehow
Dtrump: Since when were there hacks on this site?
Oreo27: ok I pressed Show Image but this sis too sus
Oreo27: Since Kill_all_fags and confusion exists
19:26:00Friday, October 28, 2022
Dtrump: Thats sarcasm there is no such thing as hacks on this site jfc.
Izzy_blight: Hack into my account and say racist jokes
Oreo27: ok so firstable, it´s "Joebivn"
Oreo27: Second, Tommyexthegamer left, joined and then said WHAT THE HECL
Oreo27: Its quite odd that excatly he became host
Oreo27: liek from all of the ppl
Dtrump: It goes by who has been in the lobby the longest.
Oreo27: yet what those chat screenshots can´t tell is in what time Kill_all_fags skips card before he broughtb Tommy to leaveskips card
Izzy_blight: Wawa skittletits
Oreo27: n-..no
Oreo27: Diabetes risk and no
Oreo27: or did Tommy just like to leave and join game as host?
Oreo27: was he the master troll
Oreo27: Only if we would listened to his whispering and one of the other would join and stay to the other game, just to disproves that... wait
Oreo27: I know cases where a new player gets host immediatly
Oreo27: Yes I have no prove
Dtrump: depends on the lobby size

Generic: HAHAHGUAHGUH
Oreo27: But by what I saw and tell
Dtrump: gen keep sending that video
Izzy_blight: AUUUUGH
Oreo27: There´s cases where some english or german dude in a forign server joins and if the host leaves, that most exotic guy becames host
Izzy_blight: Fuckin California
Generic: u said keep sending it?
Generic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBrWr7xxKKw

Oreo27: fr I made that theory that the most "different location" guy gets host. Try to join an hungarian server as american or german
Oreo27: and even though thats non-sense, the host-giving mechanism acts random
Oreo27: so just because youre best friends with azala and owns this place as the second, doesnt mean you know this place
Oreo27: My self-maded deck got deleted because bug
Dtrump: You can ban decks in games.
Oreo27: and is there even JavaScript timer or something to determine who becomes host?
Oreo27: WOW
Oreo27: Pocked Decks
Oreo27: Admittingly, I nvr understood that function, like did they only let ban their players decks
Izzy_blight: Children please be quiet mommy is trying to smoke crack
Oreo27: but tel me how. I was too arrogant
Oreo27: I go eating too and this game is bugged. Nice excuse for inconsistencies too. Bethesda knows best. sya
Izzy_blight: It just works.
Jacksepticeye: Imagine i was streaming this -,-
Barvo37: LOL

Uwustar: bye Dildorschwaggins
bye Oxyshred
Uwustar: especially Oxyshred was the most talkative for awhile, pointing out my grammar mistakes
Izzy_blight: æ❔
Uwustar: oh. And cope Evanthehusky. I respect your furry orientation but first removing decks, than banning one for speaking german with Dildorschwaggins, let game stays private, banning Oxyshred for distaining you and than me for writing "priest rabbi and a rabbi prist and an irish priest and an catholic rabbi and a jewish priest ... and a turkish and a polish priest"?
Izzy_blight: Racist Anti-Semitic furries? Now I've seen everything
Izzy_blight: Oh wait I saw those already
Uwustar: banning me too and than left the game? I knew the left destroys fun, like Jackass124 or whatever with his anti-politism and ... anti-porn, enforced sexual abstinence, ppl can vote cards for different emotion though beyond being funny

Uwustar: joined the chat.
Izzy_blight: Jimmy left the chat.
Izzy_blight: Rip jimmy
Uwustar: Also f Anteater for thinking she knows better but nvr knews that more players makes your game´s position higher. Just banning afk for "watching game" even though those ppl  have better things to do. And changing to vote mode just so that 3 pplayers +1 vote her annoying pic card with dark-blue background accidently, just so that she will switches to "normal cards" whatever that is in Picture Cards Online. I only saw that arrogant attitude in this week
Uwustar: This website will get thrown by politicla correctness and or plain abusive authoritarianism by the host
Uwustar: dark-blue background pic, she player yesterday for so long till that wins. That stubborn she is.
Uwustar: left the chat.
Izzy_blight: Misogynistic furry terrorists
Xlukas_1709x: For context: Anteater said "I have experience" about responding to why she bans afk ppl

Idioz: nice name
Zerkweiterloben: Idiotz, weiß du was über Presidentsnow 
Izzy_blight: Obama is playing among us 🔥🔥
Zerkweiterloben: Ich sehe euch ab und zu, doch nie eine Einigung sowie die Schnckncrew damals
Idioz: Nein, weißt du was über Piasuna?
Zerkweiterloben: Gar nicht
Zerkweiterloben: Außer dass sie 1 km gelaufen ist
Zerkweiterloben: Wobei I ch sah sie in einem Spiel
Zerkweiterloben: Damals
Idioz: Ja, sind immer seltener hier. Und oft auch immer weniger.
Zerkweiterloben: Vor eine Monat oder so
Zerkweiterloben: Warum?
Zerkweiterloben: Corona Politik und noch was
Zerkweiterloben: Im Lobby-Chat sind auch weniger Leute
Zerkweiterloben: The only legal German way to say niger yes
Idioz: Hab Sie lange nicht gesehen. 
Sind richtung Discord gegangen und dann war mit Coroni etc auch viel privat los denke ich
Zerkweiterloben: We nigers 
Zerkweiterloben: Doch jetzt ist es vorbei 
Zerkweiterloben: Discord existierte damals schon. Ist es wegen Corona beliebter geworden?
Idioz: Es war einfach der nächste Schritt. Und dann ist es passiert. Corona war da nur zufällig gleichzeitig. 
Zerkweiterloben: Als ob es so heftig ist?
Zerkweiterloben: Cards Against Humanity hatte unter Lockdown Spieler gehabt
Zerkweiterloben: Und erst nachdem es vorbei ist, ist keiner im Lobby Chat
Idioz: Was meinst du mit heftig?
Zerkweiterloben: Ich sehe euch erst jetzt so verstreut
Zerkweiterloben: Und die englische Crew ist auch weg, diese Seite generell stirbt aus
Idioz: Seit dem der Name geändert wurde ist alles doof. Generell ist die Community auf keinem guten Weg.
Zerkweiterloben: Oder seid ihr privat? Auf jeden Fall war das Soiel bei Piasuna "voll"
Zerkweiterloben: Nur wegen picturecards.online domain?
Zerkweiterloben: Oder welche Name denn
Zerkweiterloben: Division welche Name den Schinkencrew ersetzt?
Idioz: Ja, von Azala.info zu picture....
Nicht nur der Name. Aber ich war auch vorher mit dem Admin in Kontakt und jetzt ist er auch weg.
Piasuna hast du vor einem Monat gesehen?

Zerkweiterloben: So flüsterte ich mit ihr über Presidentsnow und so
Idioz: Hätte ich gerne erlebt.
Zerkweiterloben: kannst du auch
Zerkweiterloben: Nachträglich
Zerkweiterloben: Von Senf her EN Server

Fishmac: Und warum steht das Spiel auf "EN", wo du bist? \(' ')/

Pia: klar 

Fishmac: klar was? Also bist du Piasuna von damals?

Pia: bin nicht mehr bei der Schinkencrew. Bin bei der Salamigang 
Zerkweiterloben: Fishmac: ist Presidentsnow da?

Fishmac: Das Spiel ist jetzt schon voll

Pia: I volunteer 
Your_local_dumbass: Hello? 

Fishmac: Ich wollte nur sagen, dass wenn spätestens Zeitzeugen aus der Holocaust aussterben, dass die übernächsten Generation sowieso auf Artefakten und Dokumentationen vertraut machen soll & dass mein Autismus zu sehr fokussiert wurde.
Zerkweiterloben: Jetzt kannst du es erleben, den Konvo
Zerkweiterloben: Fishmac: Ich wollte nur sagen, dass wenn spätestens Zeitzeugen aus der Holocaust aussterben, dass die übernächsten Generation sowieso auf Artefakten und Dokumentationen vertraut machen soll & dass mein Autismus zu sehr fokussiert wurde. 

Fishmac: Falls du dich bei der damaligen Diskussion erinnern kannst mit englischen Leuten dazu

Fishmac: Mann ich vermisse die
Zerkweiterloben: Fishmac: btw „Senf her" is a german Game. An imposter.

Fishmac: Warum hast du überhaupt auf Englisch geredet? Ein Meme, was ich verpasste sicher.
Pia: ja pass halt mal auf

Fishmac: Oh

Fishmac: Also ich werde jetzt dann gehen. Mein Habdy ist eher auf monotasking mit dem Internet gerichtet & es wird schon spät
Zerkweiterloben: Pia: bye bye see you soon
Shitonmyfaceandtellme: MY REALITY HAS BECOME WORSE THAN ANY POSSIBLE NIGHTMARE

Fishmac: Außerdem antwortest du eh zu langsam und zu wenig, doch tue die Welt einen Gefallen und erhöhe den Spielerzahl wenn du Host wärst 

Pia: ich muss ja gewinnen 

Fishmac: Ich habe dich anders in Erinnerung. Wie auch immer. Danke fürs Zuhören und Tolerieren von meinem Geschwätz lol

Pia: ich dich gar nicht
Zerkweiterloben: Pia: aber schönen Abend dir 

Fishmac: Mach den Spiel mit erhöhten Spielersnzshl. Niemand kann rein.

Fishmac: Mach den Spiel mit erhöhten Spielersnzshl. Niemand kann rein.

Fishmac: Mach den Spiel mit erhöhten Spielersnzshl. Niemand kann rein.

Fishmac: Dir auch mit deinen 1 km Joggen-Rekord (letztes Jahr zumindest)
Pia: haha vielleicht kennst du mich doch 😂
Zerkweiterloben: Das wars. Ich war Fishmac
Idioz: ok
Zerkweiterloben: Hey. Wir wollten doch alle wissen, was hier abgeht. Und ich habe eine 50% Anteil dieses Gespräches
Zerkweiterloben: Und da Pia neutral ist und ich die Veröffentlichung zustimme, gewinnt die Mehrheit, also ich allein
Zerkweiterloben: Also sie hing mit Voelligverewirrt"
"Waldemarrennbootlenker"
"Noa75"
falls du sie suchst. Keine Ahnung obs hilft

Senkshub: Among Us?
Anybodyinternet: No this game
Senkshub: Idk
Senkshub: It's just two and a drug addict
Anybodyinternet: you dont know how to play?
Senkshub: No not in the mood
Anybodyinternet: Ok ok 
Anybodyinternet: What is macplant?
Senkshub: Idk myself lol. She just spontaneously buy it for me
Senkshub: I guess vegan
Anybodyinternet: Who bought it for u bro 
Senkshub: My girlfriend 
Anybodyinternet: Wow you lucky 
Senkshub: Idc
Anybodyinternet: I dont even have one 😂
Senkshub: https://i.postimg.cc/rwXLsH4p/image.jpg
Anybodyinternet: The McPlant is a vegetarian and vegan burger sold by the fast-food chain McDonald's.
Anybodyinternet: I saw that on the net 
Senkshub: Oh
Senkshub: It doesn't exist in your country?
Anybodyinternet: Nope 
Senkshub: Lol
Anybodyinternet: Seems good hows is it
Senkshub: idk if it's fake meat
Senkshub: Also taste like a regular burger with salad
Anybodyinternet: Lol u wanted some real meat 
Senkshub: Much salad and sauce
Senkshub: I expected 
Senkshub: But this is fine
Anybodyinternet: Well thats vegan gotta expect salad 
Senkshub: I am not even sure if this is neat or some vegan trick
Senkshub: Meat 
Anybodyinternet: Maybe it was the cheapest burger 
Senkshub: I heard of fast food restaurant putting meat secretly
Senkshub: So you never know how "vegetarian " it is
Anybodyinternet: Well im sure its not 100% vegan its impossible 
Senkshub: It tastes good
Anybodyinternet: Good now u making me hungry 
Senkshub: It's the sauce and bread who makes the main taste anyway
Senkshub: sry
Senkshub: The sauce
Anybodyinternet: Yeah i always need some sauce when eating vegetarian dishes 😂
Senkshub: As long as you have a stable income, everyone will get their food in shift
Anybodyinternet: Is your gf vegan?
Senkshub: Fr someone in YouTube comments post about the sauce being the main part
Senkshub: Nah
Senkshub: Idk why but girls like salad that much
Anybodyinternet: Ok guess she just wanted you to eat more salad
Senkshub: I am excited about chicken and she about tomatos. That's how it goes
Senkshub: Different preferences 
Generic: fuck vegan day
Anybodyinternet: Toss the salad 
Senkshub: I don't bother
Generic: vegans are retard
Senkshub: Just salad is overrated 
Generic: retards*
Anybodyinternet: Bro calm down 
Senkshub: Also we payed for this. I will eat my darn salad 
Anybodyinternet: U be like the next gordon ramsey generic 
Generic: naw
Senkshub: Didn't know Gordon hates vegans
Anybodyinternet: Yeah dont waste any bite of it 
Generic: lmao im jus playing it up 
Generic: but
Generic: i still think its dumb
Anybodyinternet: Tlyeah he does hate them 
Anybodyinternet: Especially bcuz of the vegan teacher 
Generic: ive considered being vegetarian
Senkshub: Tbf theres worst stuffs than being vegan
Anybodyinternet: Then what happened?
Generic: the way i see it is there are a shit ton of microorganisms using us to feed themselves
Senkshub: Same. We kill flowers and vegetables change my mind
Generic: so the idea of not using something like milk from a cow seems dumb to me
Generic: as long as its ethically collected ofc
Senkshub: Oh
Generic: i understand not wanting to eat the flesh of other animals
Anybodyinternet: Yeah but theres a difference between vegan and vegetarian 
Generic: but idk i jus think veganism is overdoing it
Generic: but to each their own
Callmelili: buii;df 
Generic: yea thats wut im saying anybody
Senkshub: It's like pro-life by animals kind of
Generic: chicken is the only thing stopping me from being vegetarian ngl
Anybodyinternet: 😂
Anybodyinternet: Me its seafood 
Senkshub: "We can't drink milk because it counts as cow or somewhat"
Generic: pescetarian, no?
08:44:51Tuesday, November 1, 2022World Vegan Day
Anybodyinternet: Never heard of that b
Generic: ppl who only eat seafood
Generic: well not ONLY
Generic: but the only animals
Senkshub: One thing I never get it: What are vegans gonna do with overpopulation?
Generic: yk wut i mean
Anybodyinternet: Wow i did not that existed broo
Senkshub: Like the chickens wouldn't stop making children just because we stop eating
Generic: interesting thought, what if every human stopped eating animals
Generic: wonder how much that would do
Senkshub: That's the end goal of vegans
Anybodyinternet: I mean nowadays we can make meat and all without killing animals bcuz of science 
Generic: bc a shit ton of cows and pigs and chickens and other animals alike have been bred for generations just to be food
Generic: releasing all of them would fuck up the ecosystem majorly
Generic: it would even out eventually i suppose but
Anybodyinternet: We can eat them but in adequate amount people do a lpt of wastage nowadays 
Generic: it would take a lot of time
Generic: yea true
Senkshub: Maybe they could run and produce electricity, still, the farmer has to make up vegan food for those animals or it becomes unethical 
Generic: i grew up on a farm myself so i saw animals and shit being born to being killed to being eaten
Generic: sortve part of the reason ive considered vegetarianism
Anybodyinternet: Oh i know that
Generic: shit fucked up my head lmao
Senkshub: "I played Call Of Duty. Now I am Anti-War"
Generic: i was like 10 slitting chickens throats
Anybodyinternet: Bro u finished your burger 
Senkshub: Almost
Anybodyinternet: I want a review 
Senkshub: It tastes fatty and fine
Senkshub: Because too much sauce 
Anybodyinternet: Yeah 
Generic: i mean yea the meat tastes better lmao bc they were fed natural stuff
Senkshub: Now we're changing colors huh
Generic: unlike them big ass factories that barely feed the animals and pump them with drugs
Anybodyinternet: Lot of chemicals are added to vegan meat and all
Generic: not changing colors im just stating the fact that ofc the meat taste better
Generic: who said u had to eat vegan meat?
Senkshub: It doesn't matter as long as corruption remains
Anybodyinternet: No just saying
Generic: there are plenty other sources for protein 
Senkshub: She just buyed it idk
Anybodyinternet: Yeah everyone preferences are different 
Senkshub: Cannabis also can be "healthy ", but than those dealers extract the addiction making part and make it times 100?
Generic: ive had some vegetarian meat products before and honestly these days a lot of them arent too bad
Generic: i cant say anything abt weed lmao
Generic: im a stoner
Senkshub: Idk but those arguments seems sketchy
Generic: ok not rly but i do enjoy smoking every now and then
Anybodyinternet: Cannabis is used in medicine 
Senkshub: It's better to take none at all
Generic: the brain has a natural receptor for thc
Senkshub: Anti-depressiva also is a medicine 
Generic: well ofc its better to take no drugs at all sen
Ghost66: I like hows theres no public game 
Generic: but some are easily more safe than others
Senkshub: You have been... ghosted 
Anybodyinternet: Medecine as in hospital i mean 
Generic: like the nicotine situation we have rn
Ghost66: I use pot medically 
Generic: cigarettes are being replaced by vapes
Senkshub: It depends on dosing, yet an ideal human need none at all
Generic: vapes are tremendously more safe for u but ofc inhaling ANYTHING into ur lungs isnt good for u
Anybodyinternet: Electric cigarettes 
Senkshub: Ppl take medicine to compensate 
Generic: and also some ppl literally just dont care what happens to them
Generic: so the health risks are obselete
Ghost66: Anything that is vaporized is hella bad
Generic: obsolete*
Senkshub: There's passive smoking
Anybodyinternet: There are nicotine cheewing gum nowadays much safer than cigarettes 
Generic: well i mean the reason vapor is safe is bc ur not actually burning anything
Senkshub: What if they don't care about that pregnant women in the bus station either
Generic: fuck kids

Jeremy90: Rewarding work, toxic team members
Security Officer (Full-time) (Current Employee) - Indianapolis, IN - August 2, 2021
Indeed Featured review
The most useful review selected by Indeed
This job is quite demanding at times and requires an immense amount of focus. You work in all conditions and must be able to be flexible when you’re needed. It is not easy work, but we know we’re making a difference. 
Jeremy90: Unfortunately, there are some folks who think they hold more authority than what their job description outlines. I have encountered team members who treat others with absolutely no courtesy and are manipulative.  They are hateful, lazy and retaliate when you correct them face-to-face or directly to management. 
Jeremy90: My biggest complaint is that these select few individuals face no corrective action or discipline because they have tenure with the company. Aside from a few bad eggs, this job has been enjoyable and the team members who are motivated make it worth clocking in. Pros
Benefits, guaranteed lunch, hands-on
Cons
Toxic/miserable team members, mandatory overtime, underpaid
Jeremy90: Wow. Such a relaxed job

One of the worst service in the world. We waited for 3 days and failed to deliver they didn’t called us or emailed. How can these guys run a business. So fed up by this fed ex. How can the staff handle important documents like this.

Jeremy90: still sus. Or maybe other companies send reviewers to downvote them? On fking google.maps ?
Jeremy90: but maybe the lack of moral and transparency make that job so confortable
Jeremy90: but again, I am just a working noob for them so why would they not abuse me and asking me for coffee everytime -,-

why do people like tentacles?
Nov 23, 2009

seriously, why do people get turned on by tentacles and rape in cartoon porn? i saw one of these by mistake and it was one of the most disgusting things i have ever seen. for that matter, why do people like porn in general? seeing other people having sex is kind of nasty.
Ahills: "Because they represent spaghetti, and that is what makes people so freaking horny for this shit."
Ahills: "As they are like penis, and when you have a lot of them it gets really hot, as we all love penis, see?"
Ahills: I overthink things. Just odd like, why not real porn then with mayn men
Ahills: As if any tentacle will grab excatly liek you want ever in life
Ahills: "It's simply because you're being misled to believe that all anime is naughty tentacles, which it certainly isn't. I think tentacles were chosen of all things because they're slimy and can move in numerous places, which makes it easy for them to rape someone. Maybe people are just obsessed with Cthluthu."

Dieviantart: Still, the lockdown was for nothing
