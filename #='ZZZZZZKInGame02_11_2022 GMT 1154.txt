Aufitz: They do this to protect her, since the villagers believe that identical twins bring bad luck. Bridget nonetheless grows up identifying as a boy and, determined to prove the superstition wrong and bring home riches, becomes a bounty hunter who fights with a yo-yo and Roger („É≠„Ç∏„É£„Éº, RojƒÅ), In Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), since Bridget feels she has proven her masculinity by defeating several opponents, she decides to become an entertainer. 
Aufitz: why is "she" proving "her" masculinity as an already male
Aufitz: thats kinda "cheating"
Aufitz: In 2022, Bridget returned as a DLC character for Guilty Gear Strive. English promotional material such as the Strive website and Bridget's official moveset guide video avoided referring to Bridget with any pronouns.[2][15] Bridget begins Strive's arcade mode storyline presenting as a boy, as Bridget identified in previous games, but is now questioning this cisgender identity.

Aufitz: ok one DLC abstains
Assmaster: this people have mental illness
Aufitz: even as a boy
Aufitz: who?. The DLC givers?
Aufitz: In conversations with Goldlewis Dickinson and Ky Kiske, Bridget expresses feeling unhappy but afraid of making the wrong choice, and the other characters relate to Bridget by sharing their own experiences of hiding secrets and of having the courage to reveal them and live as one's "true self", drawing a comparison to Bridget hiding her transgender identity. At the end of her hard-difficulty mode story, Bridget comes out as a woman to Goldlewis and Ky Kiske.[16]

Todd_clorox won the round!
Anteater won the round!
Assmaster: i agree with card 1
Assmaster won the round!
Aufitz: This means Bridget is canonically trans and is more accurately referred to as she/her, which can be summed up in the Japanese statement: ‚Äú„Å™„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄéÂΩº„Äè„Å®„ÄéÂΩºÂ•≥„Äè„ÅÆ„Å©„Å°„Çâ„ÅÆ‰ª£ÂêçË©û„ÅåÊ≠£„Åó„ÅÑ„Åã„Å®ËÅû„Åã„Çå„Åü„Çâ„ÄÅ„Éñ„É™„Ç∏„ÉÉ„Éà„ÅØ„ÄéÂΩºÂ•≥„Äè„Å´„ÅÇ„Å¶„ÅØ„Åæ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ [So if you ask me which pronoun is correct, ‚Äòhe‚Äô or ‚Äòshe‚Äô, Bridget applies to ‚Äòshe‚Äô]‚Äù.

Aufitz: "In conclusion, it is possible that Bridget could be a man going by they/them pronouns, she/her pronouns, or simply any pronouns. It is also possible that Bridget initially rejected many aspects of being a woman, but later found that they can continue to be a women without incorporating those things into their gender. I'm not sure if this would make them cis or trans or something else, but it's fun for me to think about. Due to the symbol on Bridget's outfit changing, "
Aufitz: "I personally think the most likely scenario is that Bridget is agender, non-binary, some other form of gender spectrum shenanigans, or maybe just doesn't care much about gender and just lives their life as they see fit."

i think this time around we get to decide for ourselves. i was confused before, since making Bridget trans made little sense in terms of character development (considering backstory), but now that its basically 2 paths - it kinda(?) makes sense i suppose.

still, i wonder what's gonna be official canon for future story
