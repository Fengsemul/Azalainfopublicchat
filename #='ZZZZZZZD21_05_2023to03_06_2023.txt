Jobmaker: “Stemple is a longtime feminist who fully understands that men have historically used sexual violence to subjugate women and that in most countries they still do. As she sees it, feminism has fought long and hard to fight rape myths—that if a woman gets raped it’s somehow her fault, that she welcomed it in some way. But the same conversation needs to happen for men.”

Anonone: Sorry jimmy I didn’t know
Jobmaker: Race-blind policies just ignore race
Izzy_blight: It's ok I forgive you Jimmy
Anonone: Thank you jimmy 
Jobmaker: It can never tackle systematic racism. Although let's say racism-blind policies can never see the problem in it
Jobmaker: Capitalism increases inequality since being implemented. The person with capital is always above the person with no capital, even though the justic a system shall determine who gets how many shares justly, not pure money.
(anon): and dont forget meritocracy where people who are actually worth a damn have an unfair advantage over the useless
Keigo: Show me that there's something more
Or someone else worth living for
Audreyy: im worth living forrrrrr

Keigo: ring rlly
Anonone: Ok
Ring: yes
Ring: rn im mad horny
Keigo: how
Anonone: We can tell 
Dtrump: no
Jobmaker: Firstable does true meritocracy ever exists and last, or gets corrupted by the winners anyway?
Jobmaker: Second, being good at a challenge doesn't justify moral struggle through. A person can be good and "useless" for this system, but why should we morally not provide him food still?
Jobmaker: Lets be honest, some ppl just want to enjoy life and with our amont of resources spending there instead of warfare, all of us can have a more enjoyable life
Jobmaker: Because politics is for the people, not for some merit
Ring: job stfu
Dtrump: i do too
Jobmaker: Am I right?
Dtrump: Nope your a man.
Jobmaker: I mean correct
Jobmaker: Man can make correct arguments coherently and making the closest prediction for reality
Dtrump: Men are always wrong.

Dtrump: this is my altar ego
Jobmaker: And? Do you think the mainstream media cares?
Dtrump: who?
Jobmaker: They just push their narrative. And the people believe first impression 
Jobmaker: Which is why we need filtering fake news from real news and context given
Jobmaker: Most ppl don't do research or patient behind "Dtrunp" as person

Heavyrain: E
Heavyrain: R
Jack_white: hunter biden & joe biden's comment about kids touching his legs***
Jack_white: and joe biden sniffing kids hair
Jobmaker: There is no credible evidence that supports this claim. In Joe Biden’s more than 40 years of public life, we could find no news reports, formal accusations, complaints, arrests or investigations that implicate him in any sort of sex crimes involving kids.
Jobmaker: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/12/facebook-posts/fact-checking-pedophilia-attacks-against-joe-biden/?_pmch=1597478344409
Jack_white: so?
Jack_white: why would they publicly announce that
Jobmaker: One of the most egregious examples we have come across is illustrated by a flood of social media posts that claim Joe Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is a "pedophile."

Allegations of child sex molestation are a prominent part of the QAnon conspiracy theory that suggests a "deep state" is working against President Trump’s success.
Jack_white: they literally found shit on hunters laptop
Jobmaker: Because it's their job of the journalists when they want to make more money of it
Jobmaker: inagine having credible evidence instead deepfakes
Jack_white: and joe has made countless inapropriate gestures towards kids
Jobmaker: What's ur source
Jack_white: clips?
Jobmaker: Trump made inappropriate gestures towards blacks
Jack_white: when?
Jobmaker: Yeah I will search it
Jobmaker: the OK-sign
Jobmaker: when he says American People
Jack_white: biden said in the 70's that putting black kids in public schools would make it a racial jungle

Jack_white: idk i just like the fact that trump kinda knows what hes doing

Jobmaker: There are a few possibilities for what has happened here. One is that Mr Giuliani, despite his recent record of lying about this story repeatedly, really did by incredible coincidence come into possession of these materials.

Dtrump roughly: I hoped the hacker desroyed the game Alternativ pointed him ou as if it was a dead wish. Dtrump asked if Alternative is Koda after him saying that Koda called Dtrump as pedo in one of 3 responses Alternative made to Dtrump: what drives me the most mad is when adults pretending to be children ...
Dtrump: I dont like discussions
Alernative: what do you like then?

Gay men are individuals who are primarily emotionally, romantically, and sexually attracted to other men. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations and to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

Ishipwillowandhunter: Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. 
Ishipwillowandhunter:  He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer’s thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I’m going to be alright and that there’s nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on.
Ishipwillowandhunter: The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life to a dark, earth-shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500-decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I weep, as my school and my city go under. I hate gaming laptops.

Izzy_blight: The New England Patriots won the AFC East title on Sunday night, but their Super Bowl berth may also hinge on the performance of a quarterback they've been counting on all season. Tom Brady, who was a virtual lock to win the MVP trophy, threw for three touchdowns and two interceptions in the team's 24-10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. The Super Bowl LI champion Patriots have the No. 1 overall pick in next week's NFL Draft.

It can be difficult to reckon with this loss of identity and to come to terms with the fact that you may no longer recognize yourself. It's just a natural part of life. I hope that you can find solace in the fact that you are not alone. It's never too late to rediscover yourself. It's incredibly hard to hold beliefs that are no longer aligned with the world around you.

The United States is becoming worse due to the growing gap between the rich and poor. statistics showing that income inequality has increased over the past few decades, with the wealthiest Americans seeing their incomes rise at a much faster rate than the rest of the population. Then there's  social mobility concerns.

Ishipwillowandhunter: Let's not forget that Bernie is not a rapist or fraud like a certain Cheeto looking ass man is.
Bebe: just half? The most union-friendly president they say
Ishipwillowandhunter: Joe Biden isn't a great president. Hell, he's not even a good one. But compared to Trump?
Coprnelius: still. Would universal healthcare make a difference in an already corrupt country?
Dtrump: biden is worse
Ishipwillowandhunter: Biden is much better.

Coprnelius: Joe Biden is a Big Tent Liberal, trying to get to agreement with mainstream parties
Izzy_blight: Joe Biden
Coprnelius: thats why he gets more bills passed and is more popular than Trump
Ishipwillowandhunter: And despite being a billionaire, many of Trumps businesses are going under, and he committed tax fraud. Imagine being a billionaire and evading taxes.

Ishipwillowandhunter: You use the word communism too much. It's not communism, it's Socialist democracy. we should be moving towards that.
Bebe: "As President, Bernie Sanders Will Avert Climate Catastrophe and Create 20 Million Jobs. As president, Bernie Sanders will launch the decade of the Green New Deal, a ten-year, nationwide mobilization centered around justice and equity"
Gutentag56: I don´t think much about communism I like the Arnarchist left more
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yet we're a long way from that because a certain party is denying rights to women, people of race, sexuality, and gender. They're denying universal healthcare. Putting funds in all the wrong places.
Bebe: How does "justice and equity" create jobs lol
Dtrump: stupid ass people
Coprnelius: whats ur take Dtrump?
Bebe: Criminals also create alot of market demand
Dtrump: take on what
Ishipwillowandhunter: Your people are the one's denying rights to transgender people. Your people are the ones denying systematic racism in the U.S.. Your people are the one's cancelling shows, taking away rights, and causing uproars because of what gender someone likes.
Coprnelius: you just say stupid yet whats smart policy?
Dtrump: Who is your people?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Republicans.
Coprnelius: cancelling shows? Thats both  sides of extremists
Dtrump: Both sides are.
Coprnelius: but the moderates are fine ppl
Ishipwillowandhunter: Cancel culture is extremely stupid no matter which side is causing it, I agree.
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, Trump. Your side is the one doing all of what I just said.
Dtrump: Is both sides alright just chill.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Really? So my side is the one that banned books about seahorses because of gender? My side is the one controlling women's bodies and making them responsible for rape? Is that right?
Dtrump: Yes that is whats happening.
Izzy_blight: Wtf
Coprnelius: Some on the left have said that cancel culture doesn't really exist as a phenomenon. Instead, it would be better to call it ”consequence culture.” Actor and TV personality LeVar Burton, for instance, says, "In terms of cancel culture, I think it's misnamed, that's a misnomer. I think we have a consequence culture and that consequences are finally encompassing everybody in the society."
Izzy_blight: Consequences of getting caught lacking
Ishipwillowandhunter: Except it's not. Republicans are the one's who overturned Roe v Wade. Republicans are the ones who took away the right for a women to have an abortion because of rape, incest, or life threatening potential. Republicans are the ones passing bills so the only pronouns that are legally allowed are he/him and she/her
Dtrump: Willow you need to stop reading everything on the internet. You cannot blame one party without acknowleding all parties.
Coprnelius: In 2020, bestselling children's author Gillian Philip was fired by her publisher. Her crime? She changed her Twitter handle to include the hashtag #IStandWithJKRowling (the hashtag is a reference to Rowling's controversial stance on transgender issues).

Coprnelius: As another example, Nick Buckley was fired from Mancunian Way, a charity that he directed and founded. The charity helped disadvantaged youth in Manchester, including thousands of black and minority children. His crime? He wrote a blog post criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement. Days later, he was removed from the charity.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Democrats aren't perfect either. But they are much, much better than Republicans.

Ishipwillowandhunter: And you think what I'm saying is fake? Do you want to look into the very real bills being passed?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Look at everything that's happened the past 2 years.
Bebe: Cancel culture is when I dislike it. The more I dislike it, the more cancel culture it gets
Coprnelius: I mean Republicans creates more budget deficits meanwhile democrats try to fix it generally
Izzy_blight: Ahhh nekomaid steve so cute i wuv him
Ishipwillowandhunter: Imagine voting for the party that prioritizes AR-15's over the lives of children. Do you know the leading cause of death in children in the U.S., Trump?
Dtrump: Vaccines.
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's not transgender folk. It's not the LGBTQ, groomers as Republicans like to say. It's not these drag stars. It's guns. And soon there will be no restrictions to who can get one.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Vaccines, of course you say vaccines.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Of fucking course you say vaccines.
Dtrump: Look how upset you are.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not upset. I'm listening to my music and having this conversation. I'm surprisingly calm, actually.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I just like to use vulgar language, as you should already know.
Dtrump: I said vaccines cause I know that would make you mad.
Coprnelius: Dtrump is a troll

Coprnelius: paganism?
Ishipwillowandhunter: You put Axel's name on the adoption papers? Though I don't even think you did that. You're probably lying about it just like everything else.
Coprnelius: Paganism is when theres a god in the western society I neevr heard of
Ishipwillowandhunter: No one likes you Jordan. No one here. Not a single person likes your lying ass.
Coprnelius: I like ypu Jordan for who you are
Coprnelius: Pls never change

Barontrump: Because you embarrass me dad
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't know. And all he can say is "..." say something you fucking retard.
Jordanm: wait...lemme process the fact u think i am lying rq 
Barontrump: I just wanted to get friends without having my parents keep controlling for 24/7
Ishipwillowandhunter: No no, it's not that.
Jordanm: ok, so you think i am lying? i have a lot of people on those adoption papaers, it is not just axel
Jordanm: papers*
Coprnelius: its too easy to change alts 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Either you lied, right, and you're just making this up for attention, or you really did put Axel's name on the adoption papers. Personally, I think the second option is much worse.
Coprnelius: Ignored Jordanm and their alts.
Ignored Jordan and their alts.
Unignored 2 players and 2 IPs.
Dtrump: What do you mean by other names on them?
Coprnelius: bruh how do we know its him?
Dtrump: Thats not there other account.
Jordanm: i have other family that are on there as well
Ishipwillowandhunter: Stop lying.
Jordanm: i am not lying
Coprnelius: and imagine school computer or one LAN-IP because poor school
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can't even come up with a proper response. You don't even really know how adoption works. You're an attention seeking whore.
Jordanm: wtf do you mean?
Dtrump: Yeah you can only put birth parents names on adoption papers.
Coprnelius: I mean we cant know if hes lying when we dont know the truth
Ishipwillowandhunter: Stop acting like a fucking retard. You can't even respond to me when I ask you a damn question. You lie about everything. No one likes you.
Coprnelius: Does any real life consequences happend since?
Jordanm: ok, so i am not the birth parents, idk who the mother is, that's why i put MY family down
Ishipwillowandhunter: That's not how it works Jordan. You're neglecting to mention the fact you apparently put Axel's name down on there.
Jordanm: yes, yes i did. She is the last resort
Dtrump: Not how adoption works.
Coprnelius: Dtrump knows the best
Ishipwillowandhunter: No. You don't do that. And that's not how adoption works. Even if that was how adoption works, that is a messed up thing to do.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Stop. Fucking. Lying.
Coprnelius: I side with Jordan just because hes the underdog and to spice things up
Jordanm: i. am. not. fucking. lying.
Izzy_blight: Did you know my dad works for the US President? But you wouldn't know him, he goes to another school.

Izzy_blight: His name is Jimmy 
Coprnelius: wow
Dtrump: You are in a big hole Jordan.
Coprnelius: can I jump in?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Now let me say it again: No one likes you. I have never liked you. No one cares to have you here.
Jordanm: ...no wonder why axel hates ya'll
Coprnelius: Where theres a hole, theres a way
Coprnelius: Izzy_blight: Did you know my dad works for the US President?
Izzy_blight: His name is Jimmy 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can't prove a single thing you've said so far. Nothing you say adds up. If you are telling the truth you're still a piece of shit. 
Dtrump: Oh now Axel hates us?
Coprnelius: Yes, the United States
Ishipwillowandhunter: Axel doesn't hate us, you should see what she thinks of you. And her actions certainly don't suggest she hates me.
Jordanm: yes, she has had enough with ya'll talking shit to me like this, my sister talked to her
Dtrump: I am probably hated here more then I think tbh.
Ishipwillowandhunter: The only reason you're here is to cause drama and get attention and sympathy. Fuck off you vulgar little maggot. 
Coprnelius: Alex_wants_to_die: its ok ill ignore you if thatll make it better
Ishipwillowandhunter: She doesn't care if we talk shit about you. She doesn't like you.

Infidel: Summer temperature averages range from a high of 81.1 degrees Fahrenheit (27.3 degrees Celsius) in Louisiana and Texas to a low of 52.3 °F (11.3 °C) in Alaska.
Infidel: in 2022: Regardless, both sets of data show that this summer was abnormally warm and that the world has warmed dramatically over the past century, especially since 1980. Summers have warmed by 0.47 degrees Fahrenheit (0.26 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1980.
Infidel: in 2023 already: The UK set an all-time national temperature record in July after it exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time. Other local records were broken in parts of Spain, Portugal and France, which have also been battling wildfires as both heat and drought leave forests and grasslands tinderbox dry.

Don't judge me, I'm doing my best
Why couldn't my life be easy?
That's because mine is a test

I'm always so fucking depressed
I'm meaningless, nobody needs me
I'm everyone's deepest regret
Yeah, this mind that I have is a sad one
Inasg_no: .
Foxic_catboy: This heart that I have is a black one
I contemplate using this handgun
I reminisce times that I had once
With the girl of my dreams that I had once
I used to have friends, now I have none
I gotta just face it, I can't run
I'm cursed to be someone you can't love
More medication, I need it right now
All these prescriptions keep bringing me down
Crying for help but they don't hear a sound
Foxic_catboy: Head underwater, tonight I might drown
I come from torture and horror, my life isn't normal
It kills me, I hate to reflect
I don't trust anyone, I said fuck everyone
I can't think straight but I'm trying my best
Keep all my nightmares and secrets
I try but I can't let them go
They see my emotions as weakness
But they only see what I show

Can Cat Urine Get You High? - 21Cats.org

WebYes, cat urine can get you high. You may be startled to find that “cat pee” can be intoxicating, but it is not dangerous for you. Although there is no strong scientific proof, 
Feces: why would you go into all the trouble of collecting cat piss
Feces: when you can just
Rueben: trouble?
Feces: not do that
Feces: yes
Rueben: I thought its legal
Tayssluttycummingcatgirl: sorry Cinder, you're cool but I don't think I will find your pee intoxicating :(
Rueben: Theres no law against a homeless person collecting piss
Romeo41: Suddenly, law360.com
Rueben: Bro as if the boomers in the US congress cares
Rueben: there will be always more ways to get high than dont
Rueben: Although there is no strong scientific proof, one specialist believes there are both mental and physical effects of smelling large amounts of eau de felines.

It all depends on how much you have inhaled and how sensitive you are to the compounds present in feline waste.

However, kitten pee may make you sick to your stomach. https://www.21cats.org/can-cat-urine-get-you-high/

Rina: The monkey?
Anon_with_mute_powers: no the tsar
Rina: Hm
Rina: Tzar
Anon_with_mute_powers: The English word terrible is usually used to translate the Russian word Грозный (grozny) in Ivan's nickname, but this is a somewhat archaic translation. The Russian word Грозный reflects the older English usage of terrible as in "inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful" (i.e., similar to modern English terrifying). It does not convey the more modern connotations of English terrible such as "defective" or "evil".
Anon_with_mute_powers:  Vladimir Dal defines grozny specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: "courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience". Other translations have also been suggested by modern scholars, including formidable

Findingnemo: Is anyone on?
Drunkangel: It took awhile like loading a 1990s porn waiting for the pixels to be generated left up to down right, yet you will see a tasty pancake and more pancakes
Drunkangel: https://blueribbonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Pancakes_18703580_xxl.jpg
Drunkangel: Just in case you missed the memo, pancakes only here
Findingnemo: Lol
Findingnemo: Got it
Drunkangel: https://i.insider.com/54e35f60dd08952a0a8b457e
Findingnemo: Imma go bother my friends, by
Drunkangel: I said that you shall post Pancakes
Findingnemo: No
Drunkangel: Should I call your mom?
Findingnemo: Imma go bother my friends👺
Findingnemo: I don’t have one!
Findingnemo: So stfu
Drunkangel: You seem to be tuff boi huh
Drunkangel: Really. Much potential.
Findingnemo: I AM A WOMAN
Drunkangel: Good grades. Good social life. 
Drunkangel: If you want my cookie, post pancakes
Findingnemo: Imma just head out
Drunkangel: psst
Drunkangel: Post Pancakes
Drunkangel: Being female is a threatening global hive-mind force around the world - pancakes
Drunkangel: If a male gets raped, nobody came but by a female... pancakes
Drunkangel: Or by The Pad Question, every female seems to be in cnflict, yet if someone has their period and ask for Pads, they all unite - Pancakes
Drunkangel: Meanwhile males have different political opinions and passionate interests to that point of going to war, females never had that conflict themself and mostly apolitical. As if theyre like an ant-colony. If one female gets offended, they all feel it and bomb the isolated male with Social Sanctions, till that male has no access to food and starve - Pancakes
Drunkangel: Why does everyone hate the jews? Why did the 18th century put woman in a certain position? Because the other side was too dangerous to unleash. Since the 1950s, the United States goes downhill and almost no female wants to join the army - Pancakes
Drunkangel: Females mostly change their opinions for unity's sake, males stay divided, meaning that males are truer individualist than woman. - Pancakes
Vaans: Just words a man would say. Pancakes
Drunkangel: When males master tools, craft and physical strength, females had to expand their access by the social (that sphere where a male couldnt care less, till now)
Vaans: u forgot pancakes dude, pancakes
Drunkangel: Pancakes
Vaans: to late i couldnt hear you -Pancakes
Drunkangel: Talking was the only opportunity for females to gain more food than others, evolutionary speaking. Pancakes
Drunkangel: Why do females wear hot pants in winter or can twerk without any training? - Pancakes
Drunkangel: The truth is political incorrect, yet whats the other explanation? - Pancakes
Drunkangel: In the Stone Age, the most effective way to get more food by male hunters is to flirt. That technique, the woman master for 1000 of years. - Pancakes
Drunkangel: forming a Hive-Mind, making them look themself more pretty than they are from the inside just to get males food, and flirting to get rich real quick. Thats what the woman is about. - Pancakes
Drunkangel: This is why I choose to be that gay is no sin but a response to injustice around us. - Pancakes
Drunkangel: How can you blame a male, when the vast majority of females say "no"? - Pancakes
Anthrax: fuck you
Findingnemo: Back and no
Drunkangel: You cant rape her (lol), you cant convince her (have to lvl up your social skill points), but she can do it to you, like colonialism. A one-sided relationship - Pancakes
(anon): hey jordan
Findingnemo: Who is Jordan?
Drunkangel: Theres no way you can win against woman in a long-term. - Pancakes
Drunkangel: Womans are one hive-mind interconnected to eat men. - Pancakes
(anon): I bet dtrump is fapping.
Drunkangel: Now, now. Everyone write Pancakes
Drunkangel: or post something with Pancakes
Findingnemo: No one has told me who Jordan is
Drunkangel: https://i.insider.com/54e35f60dd08952a0a8b457e
Dtrump: hi nemo aka jordan
Drunkangel: Dtrump, post pancakes

Dtrump: nah
Drunkangel: https://www.leger.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iStock_000008248793_Large.jpg

Drunkangel: https://blueribbonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Pancakes_18703580_xxl.jpg
Findingnemo: Me? Fuck no
Dtrump: a female could stick a pancake into there vagina hole
Drunkangel: Wait. That was about pancakes. Good job
Drunkangel: https://eskipaper.com/images/pancakes-1.jpg
Findingnemo: Oh hell nah, I wouldn’t do that for shit
Dtrump: you had a baby out your vagina
Drunkangel: Well shit is just post-pancakes after all
Findingnemo: So?
Dtrump: thats not a good analogy
Drunkangel: Now say something funny
Findingnemo: You
Findingnemo: Drunk, ur life is funny
Dtrump: my dick is small
Drunkangel: Dtrump ones was better
Drunkangel: short, no politics about me

US satellite state, up until the socialist they couped just one the fucking election for a second time lol.
Seriously that's ridiculous to me, you coup a socialist and then they run again in the next election and fucking win. The official reason for the coup btw was that eva morallas was trying to increase the term limits, but now that he got couped and then elected again, he has dodged his previous term limits and now gets to start anew
