Axel_in_love: I’ll always Listen risky.
Daddy_risk: if i make a promise to not tell anybody then i wont tell a soul
Axel_in_love: Hm..
Nuufithefloofi: then don't promise not to tell
Error_darling: Sometimes you need to break that promise. If it saves someone, if it helps more than you can. 
Daddy_risk: but if i dont promise not to tell then i cant help
(anon): absolutely not, keep your integrity on all promises, maybe just avoid making new ones
Nuufithefloofi: well no sometimes it is necessary to break a promise
(anon): no it isnt
Nuufithefloofi: only for the saftey of oneself or somone else
Daddy_risk: ppl tell me shit bc i am 100% real, i dont lie and i dont break promises
(anon): no
Nuufithefloofi: yes
(anon): it is never okay to break your promise
Nuufithefloofi: whatever, I'm not gonna argue with you
Error_darling: Risk. Listen to me. Me and Nuufi know this better than anyone here. We've broken promises to keep our friends safe. And it has helped. 
(anon): good take the L
Daddy_risk: i call it how it is and i dont care if i hurt someones feelings if they hurt someone that i love
(anon): if you break your promise even once your word is dirt, you can never be trusted by anyone again
Daddy_risk: error i wont forgive myself for breaking a promise
Error_darling: Would you be able to forgive yourself if something else happened? Sometimes its what needs to be done
(anon): In this case it's okay to break the promise. The weight isn't yours and yours alone to bear. Let others help. I know what it's like, it's draining. 
(anon): if someone hurts themselves or others that is on them not you, but if you break your promise that is 100% on you

Nuufithefloofi: I know it feels like it isn't possible, I felt the same way before
Daddy_risk: i need a cig but i made a promise not to smoke anymore

Rouge_killer: do you want to make it or me?
Cinderthecatboy: i cant call
Ishipwillowandhunter: MatPat suggests that Wally is working with Home to bring people in, suggesting that the paint on the original materials is Wally trying to communicate with the viewer. However, it seems like the paint on the materials is obscuring the original images, which almost seems to imply that Wally is trying to *hide* those things. Also, in "duet", when he sings to Home, he sounds kind of scared to me, when he asks, "Did you like it?" at the end.
Ishipwillowandhunter:  I suspect Wally started going against Home at some point, which has something to do with the series going off-air, and they aren't actually working together at all.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'll join a call, let me in

Anonos: As soon as he tried to escape, Rinas Pancake-Bix was already there, near Anonos X-Box
Anonos: He screams, he cries, he searched of help, yet the entire mix of eggs and burned pan-parts crawls Anonos ball-eggs and plays with them like Michael Jordan.
Anonos: Anonos kissed the Pancake slightly, as the Pancake tried to resist cumming even more chocolate sauce in his face.

Anonos: Rinas pancakes was a mistake, because since then, Anonos sweats and begs the Pancake-San to stop and continue at the same time.
Anonos: It was truly schizophrenic about this relationship. As Rinas Pancakes grabbed Anonos ass, he said "Daddy. Was I good?"
Anonos: Anonos cummed twice at the same time and Rinas Pancakes snaked away under the door and outside, waiting in the bushes till Anonos balls reload his cum-storage.

Edgylord: Yes you're the elite and I am the freedom-fighter. Get loust
Daddy_risk: na i hate school and all the people there
Daddy_risk: fuck the system
Edgylord: So you hate them and they love you?
Edgylord: That makes you a Poggers narcissisist then
Daddy_risk: i like some people there, the people that havent wronged me
Edgylord: Yes. You are like Napoy, everyone thinks you're the good guy, but in reality, you want your dicktatorship 
Daddy_risk: the people who deserve to be my friend
Edgylord: You like some ppl. But earlier you said you hate everyone and most loves you. Only deserve to be your friend?
Edgylord: Youre a facist. You reject giving strangers a second chance and you're a favoritist too.
Edgylord: Didn't we all wronged once?
Daddy_risk: ya the people that deserve to be my friends havent wronged me or the people i love, i dont fuck with sniches or rats
Daddy_risk: i dont fuck with opps or haters
Edgylord: And a hypocrite with hating all but loving those who sucks your cock, so it contradicts the first statement
Edgylord: Are you really sure they didn't wronged you?
Edgylord: Or do you create a Kim-Yong-Un-atmosphere of fear just so that they lie for your power-sharing?
Daddy_risk: ya fuck the ppl that made middle school hell and fuck the sniches that rat me out
Daddy_risk: i wont fight ppl i just ignore ppl
Edgylord: The principle of snitches generally is that they convinced you once to gain trust from you
Daddy_risk: nobody has any reason to fear me
Edgylord: Hmmmmm
Edgylord: Why do they love you?
Daddy_risk: idfk
Edgylord: You're a paranoid tribalistic then
Edgylord: and you don't know where your source of power popularity cames from
Daddy_risk: im the kid that moved away in 8th grade and came back jr year
Edgylord: its dangerous territory if you don't know why you're so powerful, why everyone loves you, and yet you're surprised that ppl can snitch you if you don't know why they don't snitch you in the first place
Edgylord: If I were you, I would collect information and spys about my environment, finding out the whys, meanwhile acknowledging and apologizing in my graves all the morally wrong things I did

Edgylord: I called Daddy_risk a fascist and he still listened to me. He's very open-minded for someone who only trust ppl who never wronged him.
Edgylord: He seems like a hypocrite, but I think his morals makes more sense inside
Edgylord: He still contradict themself 2 times it seems
Edgylord: It reminds me of medival Kings. They never got why they were back-stabbed till... some of them were killed by their family member
Edgylord: It wasn't love, it was obligation and temporary peace till the King sleeps and his wife poisoned him just to get his regime 
Edgylord: People change with their needs. If someone has no food, they would do almost everything for food. Friendship depends on their current needs.
Edgylord: And sometimes... entire personality changes with extreme circumstances 
Edgylord: The friends who you cared have the same bodies, but are different, like an imposter waiting in the modern sense to post some dark secret or cringe about you, ending your reputation forever
Edgylord: We all drink water from the same ocean. Humans can see their world only with two eyes limited. I don't know where I am now. I just pretend that I know, but do I?
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're talking to yourself. get a life.
Edgylord: Noone in chat cares. As the rain gets stronger, I run into the next alley, picking up trash embarrassing.
Edgylord: "Mommy, Daddy. What did I do to you? You hate your job too and even if I have one, I will mess up or hurt myself!" Noone responded
Edgylord: The public stare weird eyes to me, asking how many mental illnesses this person has. I ran away, hating to be judged, let alone being enslaved by capital gains.

Ishipwillowandhunter: As you begin to implode, your body would collapse inwards, collapsing into itself with tremendous force as if I was fucking your mom from behind. The energy released from this implosion would be equivalent to a nuclear explosion or a fat shit from Jimmy, sending shockwaves rippling across the planet, so strong that even Jimmy and his massive ass would feel it.
Ishipwillowandhunter: The ground beneath you would shake violently, causing earthquakes and tsunamis that would sweep across the oceans and devastate coastal cities. The sky would darken, and the air would fill with debris and dust, blocking out the sun and triggering a global cooling event. The children in Jimmy's basement would unfortunately, not survive.
Izzy_blight: Oh he would be ok with that, good thing he likes necro
Ishipwillowandhunter: Finally something me and Jimmy have in common
Izzy_blight: You're practically made for each other

Daddy_risk: (anon): i started to love the rain about 3 years ago, i lived in a trailer with a metal roof and the pitter patter of the rain was a beautiful song that i would never hear the same way again. the rain was my escape from stress and abuse, its the symphony of nature, the very thing that gives us life. the rain pulls nutrence out of the air and soil and carries it into the plants we eat. through the roots, and into the leaves the rain gives us life and supports life its self.

(anon): try ayuahasca
Hello91: not all the way at least
Ishipwillowandhunter: Very cool, do you remember anything
Hello91: it was fast. the main thing i remember is waking up and seeing a face directly above mine around my roof. it looked like my usual sleep paralysis demon but different somehow. and my arm fell down to the bed as if it were being lifted by something or someone the second i woke up.
Hello91: it felt like 5 minutes but when i checked the time it was 1:14
Hello91: so over an hour

Izzy_blight: Sorry I was busy. Yes it's important to keep an open mind
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's okay, I was also busy creating my voodoo doll. I will use it to magically finger you 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: oh
Izzy_blight: Oh,
Izzy_blight: Well I have no objections 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: yay!

Izzy_blight: I feel something in my stomach
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, I didn't even use my dick yet. One second

Izzy_blight: Call the ambulance call the ambula
Sluttycummingcatgirl: oh that's not meant to happen
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh. Was it the mayo for lube? I think that might've been it. I'll call the voodoo ambulance
Inasg_no: 99
Inasg_no: 9
Inasg_no: I'm fucked if I ever get into a situation when I need to call that. I guarantee I'll end up calling 911
Sluttycummingcatgirl: I wonder if you call 911 in the UK if it ever redirects you to 999
Sluttycummingcatgirl: cause I would imagine it would
Inasg_no: or 
Izzy_blight: I hope so 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: cause surely if american tourists would call 911 it wouldn't just say "sorry you fucked up"
Izzy_blight: if a foreigner doesn't know the number they are screwed
Jul: yuh 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: then again, american tourists probably would say "don't call 911 you don't want to be put in debt for the rest of your life"
Jul: i aint know 999
Sluttycummingcatgirl: then realise that other countries have actual healthcare systems
Ishipwillowandhunter: America is dog shit. The only good part of our country is the food and rampant racism

Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes, because they're rolled. But they are rolls? 
Jul: i cant handle this on 4 hours of sleep
Ishipwillowandhunter: and yes cinnamon toast crunch is an american cereal but if you think that's bad, we also have reeses cereal, brownie cereal, oreo cereal, cookie dough cereal, and so much more
Sluttycummingcatgirl: better get more sleep than that

Izzy_blight: Is it wrong to have a huge crush on someone and really want them even though you're already in a relationship
Izzy_blight: with someone else 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: uh idk if it's necessarily wrong, but it's something to think about
Sluttycummingcatgirl: like whether you want to let your partner know that you have feelings for someone else and to end the relationship you're in
Ishipwillowandhunter: I wouldn't say wrong. Wrong would be to act on it, I think it's alright to like someone else.
