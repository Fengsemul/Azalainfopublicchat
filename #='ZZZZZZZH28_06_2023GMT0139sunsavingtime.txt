Ishipwillowandhunter: There you are, hey sweetie
Texts: Among Us
Izzy_blight: Hey baby
Izzy_blight: Amogus
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love people. I want to smother everyone I know with love but I am limited by this flawed human form and lack of currency.
Izzy_blight: Yes. God i need to kiss somebody's soul. But I don't know how 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I shall transcend this human body and become a creature of lovecraftian proportions so I may love everybody at once. God, I wish I could love people more.
Izzy_blight: I wish Jimmy was real so I could make love to him in the back seat of your car
Ishipwillowandhunter: Try not to stain the seats, please.
Keigo: K
Ishipwillowandhunter: Keiiii

Izzy_blight: No
Keigo: No axel 
Axel_in_love: I’m scared.
Keigo: Why
Ishipwillowandhunter: why
Axel_in_love: I got in an argument..
Axel_in_love: With my dad.
Izzy_blight: Oh no 
Axel_in_love: And went to leave the room so I could try and calm down.
Axel_in_love: And he wouldn’t let me.
Keigo: then what02:20:58Wednesday, JuneAxel_in_love: And I started cry and told him to let me leave so I could called down and he told me no I could wait.
Ishipwillowandhunter: And then?
Axel_in_love: Then I told my mom to make him let me leave and she told him to let me leave so I left.
Axel_in_love: Then I hit my head really hard on accident..
Ishipwillowandhunter: Are you okay?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't understand how kids just argue with their parents. Is this a normal thing? If I were to argue or yell at my dad, I'd get backhanded.
Keigo: I just get beat no argument 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah no, if my dad's pissed enough he just yells and hits. I don't speak, I don't argue, and I sure as hell don't yell at him
Izzy_blight: I hate this freakin hotel WiFi
Izzy_blight: I wanna stab myself 
Izzy_blight: Or jimmy
Keigo: Same izzy
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can stab me baby, I can take it I swear
Izzy_blight: No. No stabbing for you 
Izzy_blight: Only for jimmy
Axel_in_love: I argue even though I get hit.
Izzy_blight: Child abuse 😟
Keigo: Yep
Ishipwillowandhunter: Seems stupid. I'd rather just stay quiet and not get thrown around.
Izzy_blight: I would never beat my kids. Just manipulate them
Izzy_blight: And gaslight them
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh yes, plenty of that as well.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love being the son of an abusive dad that I still love unconditionally for reasons I cannot explain.
Izzy_blight: Ain't the American dream grand
Oofalladeez: lemme fix dinner rq
Oofalladeez: second dinner that is
Axel_in_love: =3
Keigo: Even if I stay quiet I still get beat
Ishipwillowandhunter: Same, depending on what I did and my dad's mood that day. 
Izzy_blight: Two points to Gryffindor
Keigo: In my family don't matter who did it I get beat for everyone else's mistakes 
Izzy_blight: My dad is jerking off to pawn stars
Ishipwillowandhunter: I can relate. If my dad's angry at someone he'll take his anger out on me for any reason at all.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Excuse me?
Keigo: No pain it's back
Izzy_blight: My dad is beating his meat to Pawn Stars
Ishipwillowandhunter: Rick is hot, I understand.
Izzy_blight: I wanna lick his bald head
Keigo: I'm going to die
Izzy_blight: Don't be afraid, we're all gonna die
Ishipwillowandhunter: Kei, do you still have cramps?
Keigo: Yes 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Can you tell someone, please?
Keigo: I did my mother didn't care
Keigo: Nor did my dad
Ishipwillowandhunter: Honey, if it gets too bad you might have to get help for yourself.
Keigo: Eh I die I die
Izzy_blight: Pro tip: Don't die
Keigo: Not helping 
Izzy_blight: Sorry
Ishipwillowandhunter: You may have a cyst or fibroids. You feel period cramps but no period, so it's possible. A lot is possible. I'd rather you get help. I don't want you to be in pain :(
Keigo: I'm used to pain
Izzy_blight: I was not aware that a medical emergency was happening. For how long has this been occurring
Keigo: All day till about an hour ago and now there back
Izzy_blight: Unfortunate
Ishipwillowandhunter: Pain is natural and some people are more accustomed to it but you shouldn't have to experience it. 
Izzy_blight: No one should
Izzy_blight: never ever
Izzy_blight: Except rapists
Keigo: Ik that but when it's forced people get used to it
Keigo: I feel dizzy
Izzy_blight: If I could I would remove your pain and suffering and throw it in my fridge
Izzy_blight: where it belongs 
Keigo: The dizziness won't go away
Ishipwillowandhunter: Kiki. Please go find someone. If you pass out or something, you need to have someone near you to help. Tell someone if you can. This isn't normal.
Keigo: Well
Keigo: my parents just left
Ishipwillowandhunter: son of a bitch
Keigo: What
Ishipwillowandhunter: That's not good. Do you have anyone you can call if you need to?
Keigo: no not really
Ishipwillowandhunter: Well, that's really not good.
Keigo: Ik
Ishipwillowandhunter: Guy who kept haviIshipwillowandhunter: When she gets back, get up and walk to her. I'm sure passing out in front of her will get the message across.
Keigo: She'd think I'd have low iron
Ishipwillowandhunter: If you're crying and clutching your stomach, maybe not.
Izzy_blight: Mmm hotel wifi hurts my soul 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I was there a few months ago Izzy
Ishipwillowandhunter: eh like a year ago now

Izzy_blight: Sexy
Keigo: ...
Izzy_blight: I'll call the police so they can come watch 
Keigo: T^T
Oofalladeez: which nate do you miss kei?
Oofalladeez: I'm sure the other one
Keigo: Nate bardley
Izzy_blight: The gay one
Keigo: He's not gay if he wants to fuck me
Keigo: maybe he's bi
Oofalladeez: yeah he bi
Izzy_blight: Maybe he's a frying pan 
Oofalladeez: he said Im not fuckable lol
Keigo: Lol
Izzy_blight: Jimmy is so cute I want to kiss and grab him
Keigo: I need food but I can't get up to get said food
Izzy_blight: You can be the food. Just put your fingers in your mouth and bite down
Ishipwillowandhunter: I would get you something if I could. Just relax and don't move too much until someone's home.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Izzy I will pick you up and cuddle you without consent.
Izzy_blight: Sorry 
Keigo: But I need food
Izzy_blight: I would actually try to help but I don't know how so
Ishipwillowandhunter: You need to rest honey. No hurting yourself. lay down, nothing else.

Keigo: Much you cant starve me
Keigo: Mich*
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry I just don't know what else to say so I'm saying whatever comes to mind
Izzy_blight: I know I am not helping, I will go to the store
Keigo: I'm going to make my way to the kitchen 
Keigo: I made it
Ishipwillowandhunter: Good job. Be careful, okay?
Keigo: There's nothing to eat in this house
Ishipwillowandhunter: Except your pussy- I mean what?
Keigo: I mean
Ishipwillowandhunter: There's nothing at all? Anything you can grab?
Keigo: Hm
Keigo: no not rlly

Ishipwillowandhunter: Keigo's brother. How old are you, where is Kei, why are you here?
Keigo: one I'm 20 two she passed out three she left her phone unlocked 
Ishipwillowandhunter: She's been hurting. I suggest getting her some serious help. Y'all just been ignoring her pain.
Keigo: I just got here and she was on the floor so don't blame me
Ishipwillowandhunter: Bitch she's been feeling like this for well over a day and her parents, and I'm assuming you, have just ignored it. Okay, well did you get her help or anything? Where is she now?
Keigo: She's in her room asleep 
Keigo: And I have painkillers I can give her
Ishipwillowandhunter: Painkillers aren't going to do shit. Might stop the pain but doesn't stop the issue. I'm trying to bite my tongue but y'alls parents are just something else. She needs to see a doctor or something.
Keigo: Even if I tried to take her they wouldn't let me
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're 20, not 14. Your sister is seriously suffering and she really needs a doctor, fuck your parents.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sorry. I understand it's not that simple.
Keigo: Well it's not shit I have to go I'
Ishipwillowandhunter: Okay. Be safe and please take care of her.

Izzy_blight: YEAHHHHH MOTHERFUCKER
Izzy_blight: sorry i got excited
Izzy_blight: I have scared off the humans once again. Good job me
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, no you haven't. I'm just reflecting on the poor mistakes I've made and the ones I continue to make because unlike Tony Stark, I don't learn from my mistakes.
Keigo: I learn from my pain😀
Izzy_blight: Oh, I'm sorry. Me too. If you want we can talk about how much we hate ourselves over two mugs of hot chocolate and some Cheetos
Izzy_blight: No pain for you. Go to pain free zone
Ishipwillowandhunter: I like cool ranch doritos more, are those okay?
Keigo: Roses are red
Ishipwillowandhunter: violents are blue
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm super horny

Keigo: as silent as a mouse
Keigo: you're door is unlocked

Izzy_blight: Speaking of mistakes I kinda wanna make one. Or several. I'm gonna quickly do that
Keigo: shut it
Keigo: Izzy you can't do me
Ishipwillowandhunter: can I?
Izzy_blight: I do heroin
Ishipwillowandhunter: I do your mom each night.
Keigo: Brb
Ishipwillowandhunter: okk
Keigo: Boo
Izzy_blight: Ok i am now very angry and sad. But not as much as I thought I would be. Usually direct exposure to anything involving AJ leaves me broken and writhing on the floor but I think I'm alright. Maybe he's losing his touch
Ishipwillowandhunter: Good. He doesn't deserve to have any effect on you. Poor baby
Keigo: Lol
Hello91: v mommy
Hello91: i mean what?
Izzy_blight: I think the 10 pounds of McDonald's French fries i ate earlier have clogged and fattened my heart and made me almost immune to heart-related damage. Hooray!

Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes I absolutely do
Izzy_blight: Jimmy has cheap rates, you can book him on short notice
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ugh I also need a goddamn dating coach or something. Is there someone that helps you figure out stupid emotions?
Izzy_blight: Try my Uncle Bill up the road. He's been divorced twice
Izzy_blight: He seems like he's been around
Ishipwillowandhunter: Your Uncle Bill iIzzy_blight: Oh I'm not dead yet daddy. If you want I'll beg you to finish me off
Ishipwillowandhunter: Begging does nothing for me but it's cute. I'm in that horny sleepy state where I want to fuck but I'm too tired to really do anything.
Hello91: kiki gone :c

Hello91: kiki back c:

Ishipwillowandhunter: wbbbbb
Keigo: Thanks
Hello91: wb <3
Izzy_blight: I wanna jump up and down and throw stuff
Izzy_blight: I'm gonna throw a rock at my phone
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm sorry Izzy. I am thankful that I lost my ability to really melt down awhile ago. Instead I just sit and contemplate death silently for hours.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm happy women exist. Women are so much hotter than men holy fuck. this is as straight as I'm ever going to be.
Izzy_blight: I'm 50/50 on the existence of women
Izzy_blight: I don't like that they exist because us dirty men just use them as sex objects and corrupt their purity. But if they didn't exist, well the species would have died a million years ago, and been very boring
Izzy_blight: It's an in/out sort of thing. But not in that way...
Ishipwillowandhunter: on one hand I want to have a pretty girl squirming beneath me as I eat her out, her thighs pressed to my head, whimpering and beggine me to let her cum, on the other hand I want to cuddle and bake sweets for them.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Bitch stop misgendering yourself.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Men don't use women as sex objects. Well I do but most men don't.
Izzy_blight: Doesn't seem that way to me. Though that's just my experience, having spent my life in some pretty dark places
Izzy_blight: I have a deep resentment for men. Even pretenders like myself who try to distance ourselves from our roots. We know who we really are.
Ishipwillowandhunter: You really are a creature of unfortunate circumstances, aren't you? I agree with you partially. Some men suck, as one who has made many mistakes I would know but both sides have their issues. Whatever, I'm not here to get into this.
Izzy_blight: Sorry. I think I need to get smacked in the head again like I did as an infant. Perhaps with a lead-lined pool noodle. Whap
Izzy_blight: I've almost forgotten what it's actually like to get hit with a pool noodle. It's been too long. Ah, to be young again
Ishipwillowandhunter: The last time I was hit with a pool noodle was the day I almost drowned in the same pool
Izzy_blight: Oh. Well that's terrible, I apologize
Ishipwillowandhunter: Those were the days. My younger cousin flexing as if he wasn't built like a dehydrated garden snake.
Izzy_blight: Boi built like a veggie straw 💀
Ishipwillowandhunter: am i the only one who actually likes veggie straws
Izzy_blight: Jschlatt likes them
Izzy_blight: But he's insane, so
Hello91: kiki gone again :c
Ishipwillowandhunter: True, he is insane but he provides me with the funny hahas so I shall continue to support him. Are you calling me insane?
Izzy_blight: No, of course not. I am merely stating that his opinions on things may be... skewed
Izzy_blight: Henceforth as it were
Ishipwillowandhunter: He has all the right opinions. Jschlatt is my god in the same way Ki is my mommy
Izzy_blight: I thought I was your only mother. The betrayal. I'm telling your three fathers.
Izzy_blight: Jimmy, Jonathan and TheresIzzy_blight: *faint mosh music is heard, slowly getting louder as it comes closer*

Ishipwillowandhunter: I have no idea, like usual. Are you okay?
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, no death for my father. No matter what he does, he doesn't deserve death.
Izzy_blight: But... But... Kaboom?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love all humans equally. Except furries that fuck animals, they are abominations.
Error_drowned: Can someone hit me over the head with a cast iron pan a few times??
Ishipwillowandhunter: No :c
Izzy_blight: No
Error_drowned: Plz
Izzy_blight: Hit you with a hug
Ishipwillowandhunter: Never. I shall bake you cookies and give you hugs until you become uncomfortable and ask me to leave.
Person112: I wish that 
Izzy_blight: I will climb into your bed and whisper sweet nothings in your ears while you sleep
Error_drowned: No hugs pls, touch makes me feel unsafe 
Izzy_blight: Oh yeah us too, sorry
Izzy_blight: No touchy. Just chillin
Ishipwillowandhunter: Completely understand. I don't like physical touch much either but people seem to enjoy it. I will send you baked goods through the mail along with books I like but don't want anymore.
Person112: I'm bad at conversations, but yeah

Ishipwillowandhunter: You put me up for adoption once :( how do I know you won't do it again
Person112: Is it just me orrr do y'all in the middle of nowhere start saying your name and thinking it's a weird asf name?
Izzy_blight: Please son. I am so truly deeply filled with regret for what I have done. I need you in my life or Im gonna go crazy go stupid and shing-shang-a-ling-lang smash my piggy bank

Izzy_blight: How did this franchise turn into this
Izzy_blight: How did we get from 2014 spooky game to ROBOT KIDS
Keigo: Yes nate1
Izzy_blight: WHO WRITES THIS SHIT
Ishipwillowandhunter: Fnaf has come a long way. tbf they were always robot kids. Kids inhabiting robots.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Scott cawthorn and markiplier to some extent
Izzy_blight: Didn't scott leave the franchise like 2 games ago
Ishipwillowandhunter: He still owns it and watches over it
Ishipwillowandhunter: He also wrote the screenplay for the fnaf movie coming up
Izzy_blight: Nice. He is the god of five years at fredy's. Murkipleenus is the king. Both very cool bros
Izzy_blight: Matthew Patrick is the insane conspiracy theorist who lives in the shack near the abandoned fnaf 1 location
Izzy_blight: Dawko is the dog
Ishipwillowandhunter: Markiplier and Coryxkenshin are the gods of Fnaf. Matpat is just something else entirely
Izzy_blight: Big happy family 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I need to rewatch all of matpats fnaf videos. Ive forgotten the vast majority
Izzy_blight: Too much information to retain for 9 years. How does he do it
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have no idea. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who has no idea what's going on each time he uploads a new fnaf video.
Izzy_blight: Yea i always click on them but I never remember wtf it was about 10 minutes later, or what happened in the last one
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know almost all of security breach lore but the rest is lost on me.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh well, I don't want to think about this right now

(anon): Hi
Eggs_72: Hello
Uterus: Oh hi
Bussy51: Well well well
Eggs_72: Can we stop and enjoy this silence?
Toxic_catboy: Gtg
Eggs_72: Bye
Ozeros: Hello sweetie
Ozeros: Where are a diamond like you coming from?
Ozeros: I am in Harbard University and you?
Ozeros: That's a better university than the State of Colorado
Ozeros: You underestimate how bad it is there
Ozeros: Normally I would never grab someone but today is the day.
Ozeros: Nice.
Ozeros: Wow.
Ozeros: Cool.
Ozeros: Ok ok hold on.
Ozeros: Who. Are. You.
Ozeros: Oh. That cutie is my mirror 😎
Ozeros: After years of training, I am finally there.
Person112: ...
Ozeros: Not Gold, but bronze medal is more worth than this entire website
Ozeros: Yeah. *flex* *flex*
Ozeros: *streches muscles* Uff
Ozeros: I can't believe I got no birches. They are all too scared to talk to someone like me, Oz.
Ozeros: Hiyah *throws my arm*
Ozeros: *Kung-Fu-Style allla Chuck Norris*
Person112: ತ⁠_⁠ʖ⁠ತ
Ozeros: Even if I gain fat, they will burn right away.
Person112: Totally 
Ozeros: I am the best. I am the greateOzeros: And made me happy with my body
Ozeros: But lets be honest, I have to work through for it
Person112: Ok
Ozeros: Still, if God controls everything, you could say I was the chosen one
Ozeros: That I am the protagonist, the main character who see things through so many nuances
Ozeros: and everyone around me is my audience
Ozeros: I have to start a company and prove everyone wrong, including Steve Jobs corpse
Ozeros: Or I chill a bit
Ozeros: Shats wrong with chilling? The protagonist doesn't progress for the progressing's sake of his story, they have a purpose.
Ozeros: And right now, I reach my critical limit.
Person112: Bruh you ain't no "chosen one"
Ozeros: I am if a God exists. Maybe.
Ozeros: Or a very good almost-chosen-one.
Ozeros: Now back to my background: It was the July, 4 2019: I didn't know what to do, sitting at a New York Pub
Ozeros: I took a martini and some man, named Jimmy Fellson sat next to me
Ozeros: I looked at his shiny eyes, kneeing that he had a offer to me, analyzing crypto-currencies
Ozeros: I don't liked alcohol, but this was my day I at least tried a martini, and it was delicious 
Ozeros: Jimmy told me like a boomer:"Hey, do you heard of "MeMes?"
Ozeros: I said"It is 2019, so yes"
Ozeros: Jimmy:"What if I told you, that shitpost can create comic crises for the ultra-rich, and you're one of them?"
Ozeros: "Why to me, random stranger?" I asked
Ozeros: Jimmy : "Random, or undetermined?"
Ozeros: Jimmy:"See, Quantum Mechanics exists and even Faymann didn't understood it"
Ozeros: me:"But why are you telling me this?"
Ozeros: Jimmy:"Because it's... half-random."
Ozeros: "The chances you meet me..." Me:"Yeah Yeah but how can I get rich real quick?"
Ozeros: Jimmy:"You have to understand the whole picture. Including the boring Ted-Talks on YouTube and memes."
Ozeros: Me:" Just keep it short"
Ozeros: Jimmy:"Ok. The truth is that I don't know what I do and am still earning 1 milion each day."
Ozeros: Me:"You're kidding me. You use some method or AI to invest in the right stocks."
Ozeros: Jimmy:"There's also connections. Me:"That sounds boring. I want to be rich real quick."
Ozeros: Jimmy:"The people at the Wall Street as you may noticed in GameShops, only let certain amount of people ultra-rich..."
Ozeros: "... and the memes are there to influence children, the political propagandas for adults."
Ozeros: Me:"Well, I knew that ethics was never capitalist's strength, yet tell me what I have to do."
Ozeros: Jimmy:"You have to be friends with them, having alcoholic meetings and install microphones everywhere just to listen to others investing."
Ozeros: Me:"That's crazy man" Jimmy:"That's why I also paid Asians and psychologists for listening." Me:"What?"
Ozeros: Jimmy:"See, it's good to take risks, it's better to let someone others to take risk and you can partwise the gains."
(anon): Who are you talking to
Ozeros: Jimmy:"I or someone else makes connections, put nano-cams in their clothes, hears all the private stories from the ultra-rich and so, gain the highground."
Ozeros: Me:"Why are you telling me the useful part later on?" Jimmy:"I like talking and gaining sympathy. Did it work?"
Cameronshifler: Back 
Ozeros: Me:"It doesn't matter. But there's a too long."
Cameronshifler: .....ok then it
Ozeros: Jimmy Fallson:"So keep the notes: ***...
Cameronshifler: Ig*
Ozeros: Everyone who listen my story with attention, would know what to do.
Izzy_blight: Did somebody say Jimmy?
Cameronshifler: Is anyone else on? Lol
Ozeros: So. And Hitler is cringe
Cameronshifler: ....
Izzy_blight: I hate jimmy. He is so stupid and ugly and fat
Ozeros: Imagine being the rich 1%
Ozeros: Jimmy likes long walking a to the coast
Cameronshifler: Was this the wrong time to come back...?

Ozeros: Byeeeeseeeee
Cameronshifler: ...OH SHIT

Ozeros: Period raaaaaaaaah
Cameronshifler: And you say Hitler is cringe
Izzy_bllght: Jimmy once passed out and had to be taken away on a stretcher for whales because he ate a blue ring octopus and died, He got better though.
Ozeros: Benevolent whales puke Jimmy
Izzy_blight: Classic Jimmy tbh
Ozeros: Jimmy the III
Izzy_blight: Jimmy Johnson Jr.
Ozeros: As Jimmy invade France, putting a decisive victory against Napoleon, he dies of the Plague from Spain
Ozeros: Cringe Jimmy. Wins and still loses
Izzy_blight: One of the Jimmy moments of all time 
Ozeros: Imagine being the only one who hasn't fun
Ishipwillowandhunter: Have you ever been so depressed, lonely, and angry that every consecutive moment felt heavier than the last as if your misery was a gravity that was increasing exponentially and you knew you could never escape it? Yeah, me too.
Ozeros: Woah. Paragraph alert
