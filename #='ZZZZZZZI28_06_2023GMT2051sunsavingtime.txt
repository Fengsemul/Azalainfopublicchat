Oofalladeez: it's funny I've never been in the military yet I feel like I could do decent in a firefight
Izzy_blight: I've been trained on call of duty since I was 6. I could probably hit someone in the foot
Oofalladeez: I think Halo is better training for military than Call of Duty because Halo you have to shoot through Shields as well as armor
Oofalladeez: you have to be more consistent with your aim
Izzy_blight: That's fair
Izzy_blight: I should have been a halo kid
Oofalladeez: yeah well I'm a Halo kid and I was only decent at tactical Slayer which is SWAT which is no Shields imagine that s***
Oofalladeez: but yeah a decent weapon in the game it has to be a four or five headshot in a row for it to be a kill as opposed to one

Izzy_blight: Yes
Dtrump: its stupid tbh
Inasg_no: whatever

(anon): so worse than a prostitute
Izzy_blight: Why do people assign so little meaning to sex
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't know. I can't really judge. I will fuck anyone without hesitation. It's easier when there's no strings attached and no real meaning. It's stupid though
Oofalladeez: hey are you still here or are you just logged out

Hello91: a way to deepen the bond between you two
Oofalladeez: truer words have never been spoken before Nate

Bastionofass: Who asked? 💀
Keigo: Who cares
Zeons: https://picturecards.online/static/index.html?game=FLKL
Bastionofass: Who cares who asked?
Bastionofass: Sorry. I missed who cared 
Bastionofass: Still missed who cared
Cameronshifler: I am back bc I am bored
Bastionofass: cool
Cameronshifler: Fr
Bastionofass: now one question:
Bastionofass: who asked
Cameronshifler: Dam.....rude much
Keigo: Wb cam
Cameronshifler: Ty kei
Keigo: Np
Bastionofass: Here's one answer:
Bastionofass: Noone asked.
Keigo: You forgot the space
Cameronshifler: Lol
Keigo: And if you're saying none you don't add another o
Bastionofass: Another day of caring things.
Bastionofass: But None asked sounds weird and are you sure about that space?
Racistdick: But these words are also compound words. When a word ends in a vowel (as no ends in “o”) and another word begins with the same vowel (as one begins with “o”), they need to have a space between them — also known as an open compound — to avoid confusion.
Cameronshifler: Where is daddy ring 😣😣
Keigo: Ayo
Cameronshifler: What? He is my daddy
Keigo: He's also apples daddy 
Cameronshifler: Is apples dating ring?
Racistdick: When two or more words join together to make a single noun, like keyboard or bookstore, that's a compound noun. The new noun has a new meaning that may be quite different from its starter words. But compound nouns don’t have to be stuck together — depending on the noun, they can be hyphenated (like ten-year-old) or even open (like ice cream).
Keigo: Idk idc
Bastionofass: Who asked 
Cameronshifler: Ok, cause if they are, I need to tell rings gf
Keigo: Nice honestly the only friends I care about are on here and Owen 
Cameronshifler: Aren't you dating Owen
Keigo: Yes I am
Bastionofass: Why
Cameronshifler: Nice 👌🏼

Antianon: Nooo I thought thsi caht is dead
Antianon: nooooo
Dtrump: i could delete it
(anon): ah that makes sense
Antianon: Dtrump is Chara from Undertale?
Randomplayer: what
Antianon: Ok. We need to kill several NPCs so that Dtrump can destroy azala
(anon): Im Rin 
(anon): think you could get it deleted for free by lodging complaints with the domain registrar?
(anon): surely theres enough evidence of what a shit hole this is by now
Antianon: Dumb question, yet can't we clean this place?
(anon): full reset you mean? and removal of chat, at least from the main page?
Dtrump: no chat no private games
Antianon: Idk how to reset an entire community yet there's already one xyzzy who blocked chat
Antianon: Idk about that private games part? It's the main reason why people join
Antianon: Inagine public games saying "Go out"
(anon): Brb
Antianon: Azala must make ads to gain revenue from people joining it
(anon): how bout private games cant have chat, because ppl who know each other can chat elsewhere?
Antianon: I think we're overthinking this
Dtrump: private games are being used to farm points
Antianon: If we remove public chat and whisper, it's fine. And ad revenues 
(anon): hence why we shouldnt have accounts but session IDs
(anon): no point collecting over multiple visits
Antianon: But only public will make host and discord groups annoying
(anon): Back 
Antianon: Like why not profiting from more players joining. By restricting private games option, way less people will even use it
Rina: Rins hereee
Rina: Awww
Antianon: admit it. The private games-sector is the strongest majority in azala
Rina: I like this site. And the fact that it isn't moderated. 
(anon): it is almost entirely german but sure
Antianon: Even stronger than public chat and public games I dare to say
Rina: It's like. Having people who really know you. Saves you from doing things you'd regret. 
Antianon: Shouldnt a German own it?
Dtrump: we need moderators on this site
Rina: Nah
Antianon: Who's paying it after the donators stop?
Rina: The only thing I'd want is age verification 
(anon): we wouldnt if people used their brains but here we are...
Rina: For chatting. 
Antianon: We need bits like YouTube does
Rina: Mute loggin
Dtrump: age veriify would not work
(anon): why?
Antianon: lets delete public chat and the host from public games moderates it
Rina: Image age verification 
Rina: Do itttt plaass
Dtrump: nope 
Antianon: like we transfer the mod responsibility to the games hists decentralized 
Antianon: hosts*
Rina: What if the host is a PEDOPHILES 
Anon_with_mute_powers: good ends, bad means
Antianon: Well freedom or authoritarianism?
Antianon: What if the mods are PEDO?
Anon_with_mute_powers: i would never give this site my info to verify my age
Dtrump: bigger chance for hackers
Rina: Everyone takes a risk on the internet. 
Rina: I like this. 
Rina: It's a lot easier than the work it takes to get to the deep web. 
Anon_with_mute_powers: moderation sucks balls, but no moderation gives us what we see here
Dtrump: Rin stop you were lucky to not be banned years ago.
Antianon: It makes sense and its easy: publish ads, forbid public chat and whispering
Rina: Meh. 
Rina: True. 
Rina: But it's not like I can be banned now. 
Rina: And. 
Dtrump: Azala is one not to mess with.
Antianon: It's a community. Also 99 % are not pedo anyway, so what's the concern to trust the people moderating it?
Rina: Just cause I did something wrong doesn't mean I can't voice my opinion 
Rina: Rump. 
Anon_with_mute_powers: bans are easy to circumvent, new ip, proxy, vpn, tor
Rina: You literally find people's personal info. 
Antianon: See? That's why we need to decentralize power
Dtrump: Are you trying to accuse me of something now?
Antianon: Just curious. Who are the donators?
Anon_with_mute_powers: chill out 
Anon_with_mute_powers: both
Antianon: I feel like we should listen to where money flows or this site dies fr
Anon_with_mute_powers: there are supposedly people who have given $100 to this site
Rina: Haaaa
Anon_with_mute_powers: one even 200
Rina: No rump. 
Anon_with_mute_powers: thats depressing
Dtrump: oh yeah 
Dtrump: oh shit theres a list
Antianon: Too much restriction = less fun, too less restriction = more danger
Antianon: We need a balance
Rina: Nah. 
Rina: Mute. Sites too political rn
Rina: I'm out 
Anon_with_mute_powers: awww oki
Antianon: Yes. Age-restrichtions, bots, moderators being paranoid, reCaptcha-Checks, no way to communicate? That's insane
Antianon: It's just a card game and not a country
Antianon: Let's see what Ogrelord and the main deck contributors thinks about it
Anon_with_mute_powers: i would say remove ability to upload pictures, but that is kinda what makes PICTURE cards unique
Antianon: Just don't click it lol
Anon_with_mute_powers: i dont :)
Antianon: Why do the majority's rights have to be restricted for a few dumb ones 
Dtrump: That has been abused before.
Anon_with_mute_powers: idk i still think just giving people a session id (random generated name that resets when they leave site) is a good idea
Antianon: Still, the alternative is: make the game more boring and less unique
Antianon: I think whisper and public chat creates shadow networks
Antianon: Like, why would you ever whisper on a card game?
Anon_with_mute_powers: fair point
Antianon: It would be cheating in Poker or Uno
Antianon: to just whisper real life
Dtrump: whispers have brought in the weirdos tbh
Anon_with_mute_powers: whispers and the main chat
Antianon: Which has no point of that game itself
Anon_with_mute_powers: the game would work without any chat at all
Anon_with_mute_powers: even in game
Antianon: Idk having no in-game-chat too is less fun
Oofalladeez: Antianon can u change ur color? IM hoping dor someone with ur color....
Antianon: but agree on pub and whisper
Antianon: Ok
Oofalladeez: Thank you... It was getting my hopes up and crishing them... Not that ur not welcome her
Oofalladeez: Here
Antianon: Lol 
Anon_with_mute_powers: what about the "hearthstone" approach? ppl can select from a list of messages but not type their own?
Antianon: I wanna meet that guy who invest $ 200 here
Dtrump: that guy is in jail probably
Anon_with_mute_powers: lol
Antianon: You sure?

Game List
Oofalladeez: Trump is ptobbly right
Antianon: I mean cmon, he supported this game. Show him more respect
Anon_with_mute_powers: seems like a bit of a reach but its entirely possible
Antianon: Idont know this guys life. Can't judge
Anon_with_mute_powers: unless you know something specifically about that user other than how much they dono'ed?
Dtrump: That donation was probably way back ago too.
Antianon: What did Azala do with that money?
Antianon: Actually improve this game or?
Dtrump: Keep it himself tbh.
Antianon: Sounds like corruption lol
Anon_with_mute_powers: move on to bigger and better things than this site xD
Antianon: Imagine a rich pedophil join here
Ring: wtf....
Ring: gross as mf
Antianon: I mean, azala does not care, right?
Antianon: And $ 1 is $ 1
Oofalladeez: Antianon dont ever mention pedos to me again......
Ring: i do.....
Antianon: Sorry. It was that offensive
Anon_with_mute_powers: im not sure thats fair, azala just doesnt want anything to do with it anymore
Dtrump: its not offensive
Anon_with_mute_powers: i guess he realizes it was a mistake
Antianon: So why isn't he changing anything?
Anon_with_mute_powers: pretending pedos dont exist and dont visit this site is dangerous
Dtrump: He got tired of people begging him for things.
Antianon: I never said they don't exist, just that it's still minority and the majority has to suffer 
Antianon: Like with all criminals
Anon_with_mute_powers: no but i mean offensive or not, they should be able to be discussed
Oofalladeez: Sorry it's just things that used to be funny to me anymore aren't that funny anymore
Anon_with_mute_powers: and yeah its creepy to think about, but this site is creepy and thats the truth of it
Oofalladeez: Ive got a lot of s
Oofalladeez: going on...
Antianon: just get rid of whisper and it can't be more creepier (because they can't hide)
Oofalladeez: Plz dont get rid of whisper
Antianon: Well, it's more complicated if ppl love whisper
Anon_with_mute_powers: idk... plenty of dumb kids have no scruples about being degenerate in public chat 
Dtrump: Getting rid of whisper would deter some people.
Anon_with_mute_powers: sure a pedo would be more restricted in grooming, but the problem wouldnt go away
Antianon: Why shouldn't we get rid off?
Antianon: It never goes away with human nature.
Dtrump: Those people saying to keep whisper are the sus ones tbh.
Anon_with_mute_powers: in the chat i mean tho
Antianon: People steal for money, pedos groom because they're horny
Antianon: You need something like China to 100% eradicate them
Oofalladeez: Trump its not sus of me to want to talk to the ones *I love in private....
Anon_with_mute_powers: we have literal children erp'ing in public chat all the time, its messed up
Dtrump: talk to them somewhere else not here
Antianon: I mean, if you want to tell something cringe or embarrassing secret, whisper I guess?
Oofalladeez: Anon I cant... They arent allowed social and nei
Antianon: Still, discord also exists
Oofalladeez: am I....
Dtrump: This site is not here forever.
Oofalladeez: Discord is numbnuts
Antianon: Does anyone know when domain gets expired?
Anon_with_mute_powers: but thats the thing, what makes you think whispers are actually private?
Oofalladeez: Social numbnuts
Antianon: Azala not caring it
Anon_with_mute_powers: i havent seens a privacy policy
Dtrump: Whispers are kept in a archive.
Antianon: But true. The NSA can do stuffs idk
Antianon: lol
Anon_with_mute_powers: there is no end-to-end encryption
Anon_with_mute_powers: nothing on this site is "safe"
Antianon: It always has been an illusion
Anon_with_mute_powers: in fact, sometimes something glitches and messages from private games are posted to main chat
Antianon: Never noticed this
Anon_with_mute_powers: ive seen it happen
Anon_with_mute_powers: ive had it happen
Antianon: Sure they weren't drunk to just press /w ?
Anon_with_mute_powers: this site is meant for games, not private communication
Antianon: True
Dtrump: This site is not looking good I found some info.
Antianon: Which info
Anon_with_mute_powers: yeah, im not talking about whisper but about chat in private game getting posted in main chat
Dtrump: The ssl has expired.
Antianon: I still think it's the once who get kicked and wrote it in the heat of the monent 
Antianon: I am no IT-nerd. That means?
Anon_with_mute_powers: it means the httpS means nothing
Antianon: This site still works right now?
Antianon: ok so less virus protection 
Anon_with_mute_powers: traffic is not secured via ssl certificate
Dtrump: 2021 was the last time things were updated on this site
Anon_with_mute_powers: so instead of just being vulnerable at both ends all traffic is vulnerable en route as well
Anon_with_mute_powers: and can be intercepted and redirected/edited
Antianon: It's still directing to https even after deleting s
Dtrump: https://webrate.org/site/picturecards.online/
Dtrump: this is the site
Antianon: According to Google Safe browsing, it's safe ?
Antianon: "pretty a safe domain"
Dtrump: the info might not be accuarte
Antianon: Ok. SSLLivesMatters
Oofalladeez: AllLivesMattwr......
Antianon: Some sites have like 227,000 SSL certificates 
Oofalladeez: I dont support the movement but I agree wirh it
Antianon: Just 126,000 is max
Dtrump: This site is not worth much lol.
Antianon: 
An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted connection. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a security protocol that creates an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser.
Oofalladeez: What this sisite has given to me is everything....
Antianon: sis'te
Dtrump: I give this site a year before shutdown unless someone buys it.
Oofalladeez: The best and worse shit of my life wouldnt have happened wothout it
Oofalladeez: Trump dont say please... I beg you...
Antianon: And this Cloud company is gonna shutdown or who?
Dtrump: Cloudfare is whats used to host it I believe.
Antianon: The donators needs to unite
Antianon: They buyed before so they should own the shares
Anon_with_mute_powers: im less optimistic, this dumpster fire on wheels has kept going for years past its expiration date, why would it cease now?
Antianon: I dunno
Izzy_bllght: I can only imagine, When that day comes.
Anon_with_mute_powers: yikes, try running this site thru ssltrust and check the results (it will take a hot minute):
https://www.ssltrust.com/ssl-tools/website-security-check?domain=picturecards.online
Anon_with_mute_powers: the ssl certificate seems to be in order but the security... not so much
Dtrump: So if azala is gone who is owner now?
Antianon: A Positive Match was returned from one or more of our partnered databases. Please use high caution when visiting this website or stay clear." but most virus programs says its safe lol
Antianon: Wait, does azala even controls here?
Antianon: This place is truly anarchistic
Antianon: Damn one Positive Match
Anon_with_mute_powers: someone is paying the domain fees, server fees, etc otherwise we wouldnt be talking here rn
Antianon: Who? Cloudfare?
Antianon: And can Azala even do anything?
Dtrump: azala could be paying still 
Oofalladeez: I hope so...
Antianon: But the owner controls it?
Dtrump: If not he will be fined.
Antianon: paying would be donating at this point
Oofalladeez: As long as It stays open I dont care
Dtrump: It wont stay open.
Keigo: HELLO
Anon_with_mute_powers: well unless all donations went into a fund to pay the fees automatically and nobody controls it atm?
Antianon: Well, we don't know what direction it takes when we don't know the controller 
Oofalladeez: Hey Kei...
(anon): Why won’t it stay up
Anon_with_mute_powers: kei
Oofalladeez: Anon login please...
Keigo: Hi
Antianon: I wish more transparency than desperately asking in chat what's going on
Antianon: And researching how unsafe it is
Oofalladeez: 😔🔫
(anon): Why?
Antianon: Woah
Oofalladeez: I need to know who you are...
Keigo: U
Antianon: We just don't know when and what happens to this site really
Keigo: i am finally herre
Dtrump: I am certain that it will be shutdown in the future though.
Oofalladeez: I will die that day...
Antianon: So young?
Dtrump: You cannot live on this site move on.
Keigo: Awoop
Anon_with_mute_powers: not good to make yourself so dependent on any site, let alone this one
Oofalladeez: Trump my whole life is on here...
Dtrump: Dude you are how old again?
Oofalladeez: 5 yeara of my life... 17...
Antianon: I understand Oof
Dtrump: 17 thats sad tbh
Ring: hehe
Oofalladeez: Been here almost 6 years man...
Antianon: If you wanna know what anarchy is like, come here
Oofalladeez: No this isnt an anarchy
Oofalladeez: Its a malarchy
Antianon: Almost
Antianon: a what
(anon): If this place shuts down im sure someone will bring this community elsewhere
Dtrump: No way anon.
(anon): Maybe a new site
Keigo: Brb
Dtrump: no new site nothing
Oofalladeez: Wait there's still azalea discord...
Keigo: Bck
Antianon: I mean there's other xyzzys yet we have to plan it
(anon): people on here have other ways to communicate 
Dtrump: the discord will be deleted or should be deleted
Anon_with_mute_powers: threatyeti scores the site as 74.4% unsafe 
(anon): I’m sure we will find a new place to chat
Dtrump: no we wont
Keigo: Won't *
Dtrump: will not
(anon): Seeing this community I’m sure they will find a way
Keigo: See anon know's to use '
Dtrump: there is not alt to this site
Keigo: 6 hours of my life wasted

Game List
Anon_with_mute_powers: this is like a microcosm of 4chan or 8kun
(anon): People will already have other ways to communicate
Dtrump: they dont
(anon): Some do
Anon_with_mute_powers: lol hey were share a name server with the pirate pay, nice
Keigo: Hm not surprised 
Anon_with_mute_powers: and the server is located in amsterdam
Keigo: Hi awmp 
Antianon: Interesting 
Anon_with_mute_powers: hey kei :)
Dtrump: san francisco cali 
Keigo: Hru
Dtrump: or arizona
Antianon: So someone smoking weed controls azala?
Anon_with_mute_powers: lol probably, but thats unrelated
Dtrump: Azala is from us.
Oofalladeez: We are azala...
Antianon: I mean picturecards.online
Anon_with_mute_powers: my bet is that cloudflair has a huge data center in amsterdam
Anon_with_mute_powers: probably because of lacks privacy laws or some shit
Dtrump: cloudfare is in california
Anon_with_mute_powers: that doesnt mean their servers are tho
Dtrump: no the servers are in califronia
Anon_with_mute_powers: you sure?
Anon_with_mute_powers: https://whois.domaintools.com/picturecards.online 
Anon_with_mute_powers: says netherlands
Oofalladeez: This site is popular in Germany and Holland... Makes sense
Keigo: Nate is Nate b here
Antianon: So California actually and the Datas are red herring?
Anon_with_mute_powers: not really a red herring, the data sets control under what jurisdiction the data is stored
Anon_with_mute_powers: data centers*
Antianon: And who controls the data?
Dtrump: I think the info on that site is wrong.
Antianon: it just says its collected there?
Anon_with_mute_powers: so if our traffic passes thru amsterdam, dutch fbi can seize all our communication logs (including whisper) if dutch judge allows them to
Dtrump: Nah this site is american based.
Oofalladeez: Yup
Keigo: If Nate Bradley comes on tell him I'll talk to him later
Anon_with_mute_powers: but yeah, that assumes the info on that site is correct. if it isnt then we only need to worry about us law agencies lol
Dtrump: Although azala maybe used dutch servers cuz there cheaper?
Anon_with_mute_powers: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Anon_with_mute_powers: i have no sense of server pricing 
Antianon: I agree on Dtrump. Holding lots of data doesn't mean anything to ownership
Axel_love: 0w0
Antianon: I mean the merely location to it
Oofalladeez: Axel is that u?
Axel_love: Mhm!
Oofalladeez: U changes names again
Anon_with_mute_powers: id expect some place like china, philipines or malaysia would have super cheap servers?
Antianon: You can be IKEA owner and your Ikeas are in Saudi Arabia, the main country is still Sweden
Axel_in_love: There we go.
Axel_in_love: Ah, hello sir Anon.
Antianon: It's globalization 
Dtrump: I found the right info lol.
Anon_with_mute_powers: yeah but when the saudi police close you ikea and seize your goods... its still happening
Anon_with_mute_powers: oh good, what is it
Dtrump: the site name is called azal.info
Antianon: Influenced by laws, yet the owner is still a Swedish guy
Anon_with_mute_powers: dear lady axel, how art thou?
Oofalladeez: Yup
Oofalladeez: Or uses to be
Oofalladeez: Now its picturecards.online
Antianon: If Arabia seizes, it isn't IKEA anymore
Axel_in_love: For I am lovely, how are you Sir Anon?
Antianon: What is your source for this information?
Dtrump: https://whois.domaintools.com/azala.info
Antianon: NameCheap, Inc lol 
Antianon: Redacted for privacy, so the US laws counts as privacy or not?
Anon_with_mute_powers: example: google broke russian law and got taken to court. us court ruled in their favor, russian court ruled against them. guess what happened next?
Antianon: US won?
Anon_with_mute_powers: russia busted the doors of google's russian offices down and sold all the furniture to pay off googles legal debts to russia
Anon_with_mute_powers: its in russia, so russian law goes, even if google is us company.
Anon_with_mute_powers: same with ikea in saudi arabia
Axel_in_love: 0-0
Anon_with_mute_powers: same with cloudflare in netherlands
Dtrump: the cloudfare server is in miami florida actually for this site
Antianon: Yanderex dominates in Russia anyway and yes, goverments can do that
Anon_with_mute_powers: nice so desantis can have our chat logs :D
Keigo: Cállate 
Anon_with_mute_powers: gesundheit?
Antianon: yet Google still controls Russian Google more till the Russian soliders kicks door
Anon_with_mute_powers: but its not even soldiers or police, just repo man with court order
Anon_with_mute_powers: the same goes everywhere
Antianon: All the police was doing is stealing furnitures lol. That's nothing compare to having data and manipulating citizens with ads like Google
Anon_with_mute_powers: despite what the us thinks they do not make laws outside their borders, nothing they say matters
Antianon: Google lost yet they're still strong and respected by US lobbyists
Anon_with_mute_powers: mhm us is a banana republic, it is known
Antianon: The private companies makes their own laws and find loopholes and secret spots to circumvent it
Antianon: Russian Google can use US money to support a mafia in their favor in theory as protection
Antianon: And practically they still have company secrets
Antianon: Back to azala, it's in Florida?
Anon_with_mute_powers: not anymore if they stored them on servers at their russian locations
Antianon: Florida Man controls picturecards.online?
Anon_with_mute_powers: well except if they are heavily encrypted and the keys stored elsewhere
Anon_with_mute_powers: yes
Anon_with_mute_powers: apparently
Antianon: Who's this guy or just CloudFare
Antianon: NameCheap zinc is registrar 
Antianon: Just Inc 
Axel_in_love: I;m scared-
Keigo: GRACE
Anon_with_mute_powers: why axel?
Antianon: Dean/Rachel.ns.cloudflare
Axel_in_love: For Sir Ring was talking to a male, with very sexual urges in his voice..
Antianon: Whats ASN?
Anon_with_mute_powers: gay
Antianon: I have an idea... MrBeast donates and his Crew moderates it.
Antianon: Unlikely but a great miracle for me and the donation
Hello91: niggers
Keigo: NATE
Antianon: MrBeast is a cool guy and trustworthy. Why not?
Hello91: hi
Keigo: hi
Anon_with_mute_powers: autonomous system number
Antianon: Oh
Anon_with_mute_powers: group of ip addresses together
Antianon: thx
Antianon: The Registrar is the owner of a website?
Anon_with_mute_powers: lol np, i had to look it up too
Anon_with_mute_powers: probably, unless the owner buys a domain from a company, then that company is the registrar
Anon_with_mute_powers: theres a lot of money to be made registering desireable domains then selling them to the highest bidder
Antianon: NameCheap Inc sounds like they would be selling picturecards.online yet idk for sure
Antianon: Their only email address here is abuse@namecheap.com
Anon_with_mute_powers: abuse huh, sounds like the email to send complaints to if you want them to shut down the site
Antianon: Namecheap supports Ukraine. Cool.
Anon_with_mute_powers: gay
Keigo: Fuck I gtg but I'll be on later
Keigo: maybe
Hello91: k
Anon_with_mute_powers: bye kye
Generic: look wut u did to me

Axel_in_love: I can't say that I'm depressed rn cause my bf is at work.
Daddy_risk: saturday and sunday im closing so i wont be on untill 1 or 2 am
Anon_with_mute_powers: that is an ambiguous sentence axel, you are not depressed because he's at work, or you cant say because he is?
Keigo: That made no sense 
Anon_with_mute_powers: microwave
Axel_in_love: No no I said "Imagine" To Risky having to work, then said "I can't say that cause I'm depressed cause my bf has work" Meaning I can't say "Imagine" to Risky.
Anon_with_mute_powers: ah
Anon_with_mute_powers: yet another meaning, how ambiguous english is
Axel_in_love: Indeed.
Daddy_risk: brb
Keigo: Hey I just realized there are knives

Keigo: See you in hell
Hello91: Ki it might take me 5 hours but i'll steal a car and stop you myself if i have to

Well I am Death, none can excel
I'll open the door to Heaven or Hell
Hello91: plus maybe another 30 to find a car i want to steal
Hello91: i could steal my principals corvette
Keigo: But still I'd have to wait till everyone went to sleep anyway
Hello91: i know where he lives
Hello91: or i could steal my bosses maserati
Anon_with_mute_powers: or you could just not
Anon_with_mute_powers: you could tell them rn that you are feeling shit and ask them to lock away the knives
Keigo: Honestly why can't now be the time I start coughing up blood
Anon_with_mute_powers: or you could be responsible and just refrain on your own
Anon_with_mute_powers: because you were dumb enough to say something here
Keigo: True but wouldn't be the first time today
Anon_with_mute_powers: as a general rule, if you seriously intend to do smt like that, dont tell a soul because they will want to stop you
Anon_with_mute_powers: you told and now i want to stop you
Axel_in_love: Ugh women are so bossy.
Mostoffensiveperson: NEEDLES PUNCTURING EYEBALLS IN SLOW MOTION
Daddy_risk: eww wtf
Ring: meth feels good on my eyes :>
Axel_in_love: Oh fun.
Anon_with_mute_powers: pop pop pop ooze nice
Keigo: That might work
Anon_with_mute_powers: wouldnt recommend
Anon_with_mute_powers: a lot of pain and anxiety for very little practical pay off
Mostoffensiveperson: KITTENS IN A BLENDER
Keigo: Anyway I have to go shower I'll be back after
Anon_with_mute_powers: will you?
Mostoffensiveperson: the kittens are purring until the blender turns on
Keigo: Who knows the pain I have might as well kill me
Anon_with_mute_powers: ...
Anon_with_mute_powers: a lot of people feel that way
Anon_with_mute_powers: where would the world be if everyone who ever felt like that acted on it
Keigo: Does there pain make them not eat for a whole week does it cause them to pass out at random times
Anon_with_mute_powers: sometimes yeah
Keigo: I have to go now
Daddy_risk: ok bue kei
Daddy_risk: bye*

Gigasimp: It was 10 years ago this month that the tiny Alpine nation of Liechtenstein was invaded by its nearest neighbour and apparent protector. Yet, all was not as it seemed. In the dead of night, 170 Swiss troops crossed the border and marched towards the country's capital.
Gigasimp: 1985. During a training exercise in the proper use of ground-to-air-missiles, Swiss artillery launched rockets straight into Liechtenstein, igniting a massive forest fire along with a diplomatic snafu.
Gigasimp: At first the Swiss claimed that strong winds, which were blowing in the region on that day, were to blame for the misdirected launch. But in the end, the government paid several million francs for damages inflicted on Liechtenstein’s forests.
Gigasimp: Seven years later, Switzerland struck again.
Army recruits were on maneuvers when they received orders to set up an observation post in Triesenberg. The soldiers obliged, until local residents started to ask what the Swiss military unit was doing in their town. It was only then that the recruits — and their commanders — realised that Triesenberg is located in Liechtenstein.
Oofalladeez: No one gives a shit
Gigasimp: Fast-forward to a rainy night in 2007, when 170 troops armed with rifles (but apparently not with a GPS) stumbled into Liechtenstein. They marched on for more than a kilometre until someone exclaimed, “Hey, this isn't Switzerland”! (“Hey, das isch nöd d Schwiiz”)!
At this point the soldiers turned around and hot-footed it back home.
Oofalladeez: I GT guys for the night... If Cam magically gets on tell him I got his message... And I will cherish it for all eternity... Until I can see him again...

Izzy_blight: I play siege sometimes but I only play solo terrorist hunt cause I'm a loser with no friends
Ishipwillowandhunter: I play a lot of games. I mainly play Fortnite competitively, only solo though because I'm toxic to my teammates. I like story driven games the most.
Izzy_blight: I like playing Roblox strip club simulator
Izzy_blight: It's so goated
Izzy_blight: Man I should play the walking dead again. Or life is strange. Or tell me why. It's been years
Ishipwillowandhunter: I haven't played Tell Me Why. Life is Strange is one of my favorite games ever, and Walking Dead The Telltale Series is amazing as well.
Izzy_blight: Tell me why is so good. It's short but I think it's sweet. It helped me discover myself and feel more comfortable with my gender identity during my initial stage turbulence of awakening. It has a special place in my heart and changed my life
Izzy_blight: That's kinda stupid but yeah it means a lot to me. Though I still don't fully accept who I am and may never, it made things better
Izzy_blight: Anyway that was too personal. Actually I kinda want to play Cyberpunk again. I love that glitchy ass game. Incredible story and atmosphere. Sometimes a car goes through the ground or someone gets stuck in a wall but it's very immersive if you can ignore that

Ishipwillowandhunter: That's not stupid at all honey, that's very sweet. Ill play it in honor of you. And I agree. cyberpunk would've been a masterpiece if they would've just taken a little bit more time to perfect it
Izzy_blight: Aww. Honestly, with all the fixes that have been made over the last 3 years or so, I'd argue Cyberpunk is a masterpiece. It's just a shame that it's taken so long for it to actually become one, so long after all the damage has been done. Unacceptable on CD Projekt Red's part. For shame.
Ishipwillowandhunter: There was such a rush to get it done. It's partially the fan bases fault. we pushed things a bit too much and they gave us a game that wasn't really done, I don't know what we expected. 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ghost of Tsushima is probably my favorite game right now though.
Izzy_blight: That's true. I haven't actually played Ghost of Tsushima. I've heard it's excellent. I might pick it up next time I embezzle some excess funds
Izzy_blight: from Jimmy Evil Incorporated
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Combat is simple yet fantastic. I haven't gotten to play most of it story wise, I did almost every side quest just to prolong it.

Ufoberr: Didn't know Dietwater was a thing
Oppaienjoyer: https://thumbsnap.com/s/rau1YCEb.png?0701
Person112: Why is everybody breaking their collarbones? I swear like so many people have broken it
Oofalladeez: Ouch... Most painful bone to break...
Ufoberr: Oppaienjoyer really enjoys Oppais
Inasg_no: my brother got a concussion from a bike once, he had this gokart and was on it, bike toppled over on him and knocked him out. Ambulance n everything 
Person112: Alright bye everyone 
Ufoberr: Too bad Inasg has no OnlyFans to pay her moms medical bills
Inasg_no: STAY
Ufoberr: just dropping
Inasg_no: I'm in uk 
Inasg_no: Free healthcare bitch 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: hell yeah xD
Dietwater: Are y’all even in a game rn
Oofalladeez: I thought that was Canada
Sluttycummingcatgirl: nope
Inasg_no: don't play that game with me UFO XD 
Ufoberr: Free? More like from state-engorced taxes healthcare
Daddy_risk: i broke both my ankles once
Ufoberr: enForced
Sluttycummingcatgirl: I mean yeah
Ufoberr: Do you like being Forced to Pay, or Force to sell?
Daddy_risk: one on a trampoline and the other in a moter bike acident
Daddy_risk: accident*
Ufoberr: You know it's still expensive, just the costs are hidden, right? A human is still expensive
Sluttycummingcatgirl: yeah ofc
Sluttycummingcatgirl: nobody's denying that lmao
Ufoberr: Finally someone has common sense
Inasg_no: my bbg <3
Ufoberr: "Free" healthcare
Sluttycummingcatgirl: free at entry anyway
Sluttycummingcatgirl: which is better than having to pay huge amounts when you do go to the hospital
Ufoberr: I see no difference
Inasg_no: yeah >:c
Inasg_no: fuck usa
Ufoberr: in the end of the day, someone has to pay 
Daddy_risk: nah ust fuck our government
Sluttycummingcatgirl: yes, but the difference is payment when going to the hospital vs paying taxes
Oofalladeez: Internationals hate the US
Inasg_no: I'm not international 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: except in the first option you have taxes as well anyway, they just go to other stuff
Inasg_no: I'm from California. I hate it still tho 
Inasg_no: plus my bbg in Britain so 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: <33333
Ufoberr: You still pay, just this time for all the other people who abuse the hospital too
Ufoberr: It sucks more when the taxpayer pages for ppl they don't know with zero responsibility 
Ufoberr: pays*
Sluttycummingcatgirl: as opposed to america where taxpayers only pay for themselves and nobody else right xD
Ufoberr: Taxes are everywhere. Yet by private, you're accountable for your damages more
Ufoberr: The US is more private so
Inasg_no: i belong to mich
Ufoberr: How does belonging to much saves Covid?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Taxes aren't even that much higher in reality. Either I pay a somewhat larger portion in taxes or I spend 200k getting my heart replaced. Its easy
Sluttycummingcatgirl: you have options in the UK, both public and private, personally I'd say healthcare is a right that should be afforded to everyone :p
Ufoberr: I shut up for a while
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes, you do belong to me <3
Sluttycummingcatgirl: so when I start paying taxes, if I have to pay more so that others have that right, so be it
Ufoberr: Well, that's an expensive human right, don't you think? 
Sluttycummingcatgirl: sure, but I think it's a worthwhile human right
Ufoberr: Ask the same question when you need military against Russia and China
Ufoberr: Everything costs

Ufoberr: The sun is outdated
Ufoberr: We don't need it anymore
Ufoberr: The sun is like Palastine, it doesn't build, it only destroys
Ufoberr: We will write history, in Cards Against Humanity
Ufoberr: The first Anti-Sun-Movement, son
Oofalladeez: Cya
Oofalladeez: Ima dip too
Ufoberr: Both sides, the left and right failed to take the sun. This is basically what is all about in climate change: The Suns strength 
Ufoberr: The left wants to give the sun a chance and enforces the guilt culture that we humans must change, not nature despite nature being our parents
Ufoberr: And the right ignores the sun
Ufoberr: We need both. Denying the Suns existance and we humans must change to be combative Against the sun.
Ufoberr: This is what happens when my teacher refuses to turn the air conditioner on: A speech about how to destroy the sun
Ufoberr: According to scientists, the sun even gets stronger and hotter
Ufoberr: Like... can you stop? Please, sun.
Person112: Heyy

Ufoberr: It always continues
Oppaienjoyer: https://thumbsnap.com/i/geea4v2r.jpg?0701
Ufoberr: Standing up, brushing teeth, going to school, fap, being screamed by my mom, joining chat, put my cards in deck, eats, drinks, poop, piss
Ufoberr: its a cycle and nothing changes.
Terry25: add calling gingers racial slurs to your list
Ufoberr: Even if the Russians declare war on Liberals, we go the same path over and over again
Ufoberr: china will beat us, the West is behind and will go to another civil war because there are more elites than there's space to be the 1%
Izzy_blight: My path is covered in blood and mud and cum
Ufoberr: We just laugh but nothing changes. Just ignoring and continue their roleplaying and personality flaws.
Ufoberr: It's a question of time till they all ignore my warnings and call to action
Izzy_blight: Might as well just ignore it. Nothing we can do. Things will never change
Ufoberr: You're all hypocrites. You can change but refuse to do it.
Izzy_blight: Can't fight the powers that be 
Izzy_blight: Yeah cause change takes heart and we're all cowards
Ufoberr: You could stopped Trump but nooo... you just tolerate what others told you and sit behind tv
Oppaienjoyer: https://i.postimg.cc/m2q8cMZP/pb.png
Ufoberr: What's a heart with it? $ 1000 on darknet?
Ufoberr: It's uncomfortable yet accepting the status quo doesn't make it better
Ufoberr: George Bush didn't had a majority in 2000s and yet the Americans accepted them
Oppaienjoyer: https://thumbsnap.com/i/pqGGy7sD.mp4
Ufoberr: it wasn't even in the democratic system that Bush won first time, yet the people just continued the path

Ufoberr: Just keep living in your world, in your bubble and support president's war crimes with your taxes and social media
Ufoberr: your vote and your given legitimacy
Keigo: T^T
Izzy_blight: Life's too short to care about things you can't change man. You're wasting your youth on it. Worry about politics when you're a middle-aged married man. That's the only demographic that politics are made for
Ufoberr: Politics governs everyone
Ufoberr: Paying taxes and prices, being in war as solider, the news, opinions, politics is everywhere
Oppaienjoyer: https://i.postimg.cc/kGGLCmsz/4433363c3cf6e6c36d2b90de7b0270a4.jpg
Izzy_blight: But no one cares about them because they're boring and soul-sucking.
Ufoberr: The rights and the police hunting ppl too
Ufoberr: We are controlled by politics right now
Ufoberr: why do you think this website exists
Oppaienjoyer: https://i.postimg.cc/HLmKx53Q/k9wiZ05.png
Ufoberr: Because communism falls and US persists 
Ufoberr: The US made internet commercial which enables privacy here
Ufoberr: california owns all domains right now
Ufoberr: idk your background story, yet your parents probably survived because of their citizenship, which grands them protection from foreign countries and access to social services in return to taxes and holding loyality to the goverment 
Ufoberr: Thats why formally, it's the American people's fault for Iraq War

Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah. I don't think I have a single simple relationship. A few of my friendships involve exchanging nudes and erp. A lot actually. Then there's the love/hate relationships. And my real love life which is even more fucked.
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry. If it would make you feel better i can do furry erp with you any time
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's alright, I don't really care. The pussy/dick pics are nice at least. There was a time when I hate furries with all my heart and soul but now I like one so I'm not sure. 
Dtrump: ?
Izzy_blight: You have weird friends. But so do I so I can't say anything on that matter. The person I love most in the world is a furry but I think furries likely corrupted him. So I don't know where to stand on them
Hello91: .
Keigo: Nat
Izzy_blight: ,
Ishipwillowandhunter: "friends". I barely know half of them. The furry community is toxicity at it's finest, there are just 2 select furries I like. 
Hello91: KIIIIII
Izzy_blight: I'm not a furry but I like to call myself a kitsune. I don't have a fursona I just identify as a deceiving mischievous little creature
Ishipwillowandhunter: That's cute. I do like that. I identify as a mistake
Izzy_blight: You are not a mistake you are a threat to national security
Izzy_blight: My living weapon. Mommy has big plans for you 
Izzy_blight: my good boy is going to take over the world one day
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't know how to feel about most of what you just said. 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Why is bullying a thing? like tf why are you mad that I'm fucking ugly
Ishipwillowandhunter: Why is horniness a thing? I don't like being in a state where random things make me hard and I feel the need to do things I'll regret later
Izzy_blight: Now we're asking the real questions
Ishipwillowandhunter: I need sleep
Ishipwillowandhunter: and a lot of it
Izzy_blight: How much did you sleep today
Ishipwillowandhunter: none
Izzy_blight: Go to bed right now
Ishipwillowandhunter: I got off and then immediately had to get up to help my dad.
Izzy_blight: Oh no 
Ishipwillowandhunter: No
Ishipwillowandhunter: what?
Izzy_blight: Jimmy is touching my chest and snuggling with me and sniffing my head
Izzy_blight: He is so creepy and weird I hate it when he does this 
Ishipwillowandhunter: No :( tell him to get off, that's my spot. I want to lay on your chest and play with your c- I mean hair. Let me snuggle, I'm lonely
Izzy_blight: I'll kill Jimmy with a rubber fork and let you finger me until I throw up tomorrow if you go to bed
Dtrump: rubber fork
Izzy_blight: Fubber rork
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not going to bed, sorry darling. I'm jealous of how easy it is for women to look good.
Izzy_blight: Me too. Hypothetically speaking what would it take for you to go to sleep for days and days
Keigo: Guys I stole my grandfather's phone to be here
Izzy_blight: That's not nice. Consider returning it
Dtrump: go to jail now
