Tallguy: I miss her personality and how she always wanted a hug
Tallguy: and how she would hug me when she felt to overloaded from sounds
Izzy_blight: Cute. I would have loved to know her. I'm averse to physical touch though so the hugs would make me vomit
Tallguy: Also she would scream at me for so long  if we do meet up lol
Izzy_blight: Yummy
Tallguy: I like how you wannna get fucked but you hate people touching you lmao
Izzy_blight: Yeah I'm very complicated. Anyway,
Tallguy: That was so vulgar
Tallguy: I apologize
Izzy_blight: No it's ok honey I understand
Tallguy: anyways
Tallguy: Also girl im only a year younger than you dont honey me like ur 40

Tallguy: thats so sucky
Izzy_blight: Very. Makes me wanna shoot myself.
Tallguy: I dont like sharing a room with people that I dont wanna share a room with
Tallguy: No I hate it
Izzy_blight: Ikr. I hate having an old man watching me eat and sleep. And I hate having to watch him do the same
Izzy_blight: AND I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO WATCH PORN
Izzy_blight: i need it so bad 
Tallguy: I be having to many urges if yk what I mean and that would drive me crazy
Tallguy: I need to line up a plan to get some after I get out of boot camp
Izzy_blight: I'm such a pervert. I have to touch myself at least three or four times a day. I get very grumpy when I can't
Tallguy: can you do while he sleeps ?
Izzy_blight: I did once. Felt too risky though cause he's not a heavy sleeper
Izzy_blight: I barely got away with it. He wakes up so much at night 
Tallguy: you actually finish is crazy lol
Tallguy: *finishing*
Tallguy: I create to much of a mess so its way harder if people are in the room
Tallguy: Cause ill have makesure it doesnt get on my clothes and I have to clean it off of me or my dick 
Izzy_blight: I usually don't cum that much so it's easy to subdue initially but more seeps out as I come down from climax. It can take a while to get it all out and wiped up. It's inconvenient
Izzy_blight: Why am I telling you that? I don't know. Yuck, sorry
Tallguy: Ive told you about my experience first so i should be saying sorry
Tallguy: not to sound weird but your experience sounds interesting
Izzy_blight: You're an exploder, I'm a leaker. We both know that about each other now, I guess
Tallguy: this should been a private convo lmao
Izzy_blight: Yeah probably 
Tallguy: actually how does it come out for you, is it white or clear ?
Tallguy: if you dont mind answering
Izzy_blight: Mix of both. Clear stuff mostly with globs of sticky white stuff
Tallguy: For me it depends on how long since i came
Tallguy: and a bit on my diet
Izzy_blight: I eat dirt and sticks
Izzy_blight: Healthy diet 👌
Tallguy: its clear when i do it a lot and a bit sticky but when i dont do for a while its white and thicc
Tallguy: dirt and sticks dont sound like enough lmao
Izzy_blight: Mmm maybe mine would be thicc if I went a while without... you know. But nah no way I'm doing that
Tallguy: also its veryyyyy sticky when i dont do for a while
Izzy_blight: Owo
Izzy_blight: Natural glue.

Warfare: Ok. Let's make abortion and meat illegal then
Yrd: abortion should be legal

Warfare: How
Daddy_risk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmHiZQRaso0

Assmaster: https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk8FKnx/1341160320217.jpg
Daddy_risk: bc they decided to end someone elses

Yrd: lets skip the fact how schools ystems basically fucking brainwash u
Warfare: Ye problem with killing ppl is that you can't reversed it
Daddy_risk: ive never heard of someone getting the death sentence for tax evasion
Warfare: What if you killed the wrong person
Yrd: wait
Yrd: lemme google smt
(anon): fun fact: czech republic castrates child molesters so they cant repeat offend. 
Daddy_risk: we are both saying the death sentence is bad but for different reasons
Warfare: That actually makes sense
Warfare: But you said death penalty 
Warfare: I think killing any person is wrong
Daddy_risk: ur saying nobody deserves it bc its "against human rights" boo fucking hoo
Yrd: anon thats a great thing
(anon): i think so
Yrd: no it really is
Warfare: Depends if they are really sure if they molested one
(anon): but then i also think abortion is murder, so what do i know
Yrd: if theres video proof

Yrd: or just
Daddy_risk: im saying nobody deserves it bc its way too easy for someone who commited horable crimes
Yrd: general proof
Warfare: When you lose your balls, there's no way back 💀
Yrd: u can always get the fuckin
Yrd: genital change surgery or some shit
Yrd: whatever
Yrd: i dont care about that mental illness
Daddy_risk: idc if its against human rights, if someone killed a child they deserve to be tortured every day for the rest of thier miserable fucking life
Warfare: It just isn't the same as with mine which I grow up 😔
Yrd: killing a kid is crazy
Warfare: Tortured? Are you a satanist?
Yrd: at some point yes
(anon): i hear where youre coming from risk, but that goes too far for me
(anon): they will answer to God
Warfare: Woah. Just give them some psychological experiment and he assimilates
Yrd: nothing goes too far if they kill a child
(anon): and the sooner we send them there the sooner they do
Daddy_risk: no i believe that if u hurt a child u should be given the worst treatment possible
Warfare: Or medicines
Yrd: warfar
Warfare: What if a child hurts a baby?
Yrd: warfare
Yrd: that "medicine"
Warfare: My name?

Daddy_risk: do to criminals wht the nazi doctors did to jews
Warfare: Anyone which fixes rapist to rape zero
Yrd: it actually just fucks u up even further
Yrd: its not worth it
Daddy_risk: experiment on them while they are still awake
Warfare: At least I try to fix them. You all went to satanistic torture and death
Yrd: torture isnt satanistic tho
Warfare: It can go different ways
Daddy_risk: oh ya if its a small crime rehabilitate
Dtrump: it can be
Yrd: theres different types of torture
Yrd: if we go to skinning alive
Yrd: then sure

Daddy_risk: non violent drug offenders/dealers rehabilitate
Warfare: True
Daddy_risk: preditors torture
Yrd: yeah but if u distribute drugs to a minor
Daddy_risk: sex offenders should never be put back on the strreats
Warfare: If they grow up in a place where there's no children and are imprisoned there, then they can never rape
Yrd: thats a diff thing
Warfare: Like just cut off the opportunities to become a bad person
Yrd: that wont work
Yrd: unless they send people on like
Warfare: It's better than torture
(anon): then at least let them choose between prison or death, better for them, better for the tax payer
Yrd: fucking
Yrd: islands
Yrd: in the arctic
Warfare: They can kill themself
Warfare: The state giving taht power is too much
Yrd: werent u just talking about how "death" is bad
Yrd: or some shit
Warfare: Yes. Except they want too taht much
Daddy_risk: idk man giving drugs to a minor is a grey area imo, one one hand yea its fucked up. on the other hand people habve to make money and that kid is still going to get drugs from someone else if you dont sell to him
Warfare: In that case, I don't want them to force them either
Yrd: right risk
Yrd: funniest thing is
(anon): this may come as a shock but prisons generally try to prevent suicides leading to higher chance of survival
Yrd: that 13 year olds can find drug dealers but the cops cant
Warfare: Yeah right just if they strongly want too with proof to kill themself then it's their choice
Warfare: Yet 99% wants to stay alive
Warfare: And death penalty is against consent too for the subject
Yrd: if u know ur gonna die
Yrd: why the fuck murder someone
Yrd: in the first plac
Warfare: Idk. Ask them 
Yrd: like what the fuck just dont
Warfare: There are individuals with different reasons
Yrd: keep ur schizophrenia on locks bud
Daddy_risk: if i was a dealer i would rather know a kid is getting clean drugs from me that risk them getting fent from the dealer down the road who cuts his shit with baby powder and fent
Warfare: thats why we have courts in the firsts place
(anon): i still think castrating them is better, but letting them choose death penalty over life in prison, is better than forcing a life of suffering on them and huge expenses on the tax payer
Yrd: alr alr wait yall
Yrd: sort this out
Yrd: im confused
Yrd: theres a delay between info
Warfare: I am against death penalty
Dtrump: They get killed and come back as a different person.
Warfare: And believe we should fear the government more than some criminal. 
Daddy_risk: im against the death penalty bc its the easy way out for scumbags who deserve worse than that
Warfare: You mean they change their mind?
Yrd: yeah no listen the government
Yrd: just overall
Daddy_risk: ima g i getting too worked up over an argument on the internet that doesent matter
(anon): if they deserve worse, then God will see to that after their death, riskyy

Warfare: Idk. Maybe 1 do, maybe they don't. I never talked to those guys everyone each
Yrd: he doesnt give a single fuck about that
Axel_in_love: .,jmhgbfvdvdcd
(anon): concience, moral compass, orthodoxy
Warfare: It's still morally wrong 
Yrd: i mean its really just how he feels
Warfare: Some people will stop them, especially after we have social media
Warfare: More people gonna get exposed
Yrd: media shouldnt exist
(anon): he will answer to God, it is not our place to make him suffer
Warfare: good luck living in middle age again
Yrd: especially not media controlled by the government
Warfare: true
Yrd: fuck that shit
Yrd: if there was
Yrd: NO FUCKING COUNTRY
Yrd: but just
Warfare: We need to support independent journalism
Yrd: 1 whole ass unified earth

Yrd: it would be:
Yrd: cheaper
Yrd: better
Yrd: less corrupt
Yrd: maybe
Yrd: less criminals
Yrd: thats a maybe too
Yrd: a lot more diversity

Yrd: i wouldnt hate people so much
Yrd: i know more about foreign countries than my own country
Warfare: Context?
Yrd: on what
Warfare: "foreign countries than my own country
Warfare: Or just general rant

Yrd: i dont care about the war
Yrd: honestly
Yrd: but the ukrainians
Yrd: are annoying pricks
Warfare: There are good and bad people everywhere
Yrd: these motherfuckers think

(anon): idk what western propaganda is reporting but wagner supports putin, just not his appointees like shoigu and gerasimov
Warfare: I can't tell. Right now Russian soliders are inside Ukraine and war support decreases. And too diverse logistics.
Dtrump: Wagner is pretty scummy it seems.
(anon): no?
Warfare: Both sides are
Warfare: What media should we trust?
Yrd: if russia didnt exist
Yrd: in the first place
Yrd: many conflicts could have been prevented
Warfare: Russia Today says Russia good and US Today says USA
(anon): because they are a pmc they have the freedom to reject contracts that they deem immoral, making them less scummy than the regular military most times
Warfare: But here's the thing: Lies exists
Yrd: u can catch out lies very easily
Warfare: Who in this chat was in Russia or knows some Russian?

Yrd: oh really?
(anon): then in 1917 two revolutions took place
(anon): in russia
Yrd: thats just history
Warfare: Because Ukraine joined Russia because orthodox Christianity or am I wrong?
Yrd: uh

Yrd: that ukraine existed before russia
Yrd: that was before the 900's
Warfare: Yeah I know
(anon): as a result of these revolutions, new states were created in the west of (former) russia
Yrd: therefore russia has absolutely no fucking history
Warfare: Not exactly but yeah
(anon): belarus and ukraine
Dtrump: They have always fought.
(anon): that had NEVER existed before
Warfare: So anon describes the creation of the Soviet Union?
Yrd: uh
Yrd: i think
Yrd: the 1917 revolution sounds like lenin taking over
Dtrump: Russia wanted afghanistan too.
(anon): who lived on that land? poles, russians, hungarians, cossacks, tatars, ruthenes/rusyn, a few serbs, jews and armenians, etc
Warfare: I played Paradox History video games and I can recall Ukraine Nationalists existing under Russia
Warfare: Like in Victorian period
Warfare: Or anyone knows EU IV?
(anon): the soviet authorities in russia, ukraine and poland, worked together to clear that land of its inhabitants
(anon): they were either exterminated or forcibly relocated
Warfare: I mean... Nations as a whole are social constructs

(anon): so when stalin allies with hitler, they are eager to join the nazis
(anon): they spend most of pre ww2 period massacring poles and jews
(anon): then hitler and stalin have a falling out
Warfare: During the Middle Ages, Ukraine was the site of early Slavic expansion and the area later became a key centre of East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century. The state eventually disintegrated into rival regional powers and was ultimately destroyed by the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. 
Yrd: dont talk about the poles i beg
(anon): but surprise, the ukrainians have gotten a taste for polish, jewish and hungarian blood, so they join hitler instead of stalin
(anon): eventually they are defeated and brought back into line by the soviet union, but their ideology of nazism remains
Warfare: The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between Russia and Poland, and ultimately absorbed by the Russian Empire. Ukrainian nationalism developed, and following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic was formed. 
Dtrump: whose a nazi?
(anon): in 1991 they again regain indepense with the dissolution of the soviet union
Warfare: For me it sounds like the culture existed earlier but the ideology and awareness of their already existing culture raised later and their peak was 1917
(anon): and they go right back to their genocidal ways
(anon): murdering their neighbors, elminating their languages and religion
Warfare: Nationalism and seperation against stronger foreign powers. How does that justify the invasion through?

Warfare: Jingoism during a war is normal. And nationalist ideology increases if you are racist towards Ukraines

Axel_in_love: Hi!
Djshrimpdick: peepee poopoo
Ring: hi
Ring: sup :>
Djshrimpdick: sup
Ring: happy 4th
Djshrimpdick: yes
Djshrimpdick: hapi furth
Djshrimpdick: O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
Djshrimpdick: On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,
'Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
Djshrimpdick: And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
Djshrimpdick: O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation!
Blest with vict'ry and peace may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserv'd us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto - "In God is our trust,"
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

In the UK we don't formally celebrate July 4, since it's obviously the day the US decided to leave the Empire. However, with plenty of Americans moving over here, and with many of us happy for a good reason for a party, events are becoming more prevalent.1 day ago

Iglosnat: You think theres normal people in government?
Dtrump: Nope no ones normal in this world.
Anon_with_mute_powers: which government? :)
Anonone: Every government
Iglosnat: The anarchistic-marxist comitee who determines which can food you get ofc
Anon_with_mute_powers: power corrupts, so you need to be cut out of really good Christian material to withstand that. E.g. Putin
Iglosnat: Thats why god is evil
Iglosnat: God has infinite power basically
Anon_with_mute_powers: and not even he is perfect
Iglosnat: lol so why catholic god?
Anon_with_mute_powers: merely a vessel filled by the Holy Spirit performing God's Will

Anon_with_mute_powers: imagine. biden a christian. pelosi a christian. pope francis a christian. xD hilarious, but also kinda blasphemous
Anon_with_mute_powers: the original? lol i know im old, but im not THAT old
Iglosnat: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Stele_Licinia_Amias_Terme_67646.jpg/250px-Stele_Licinia_Amias_Terme_67646.jpg
Iglosnat: raised from the dead and exalted by God, just to die again and neevr respawn
Anon_with_mute_powers: ive had my share of close encounters with death, but ive never been resurrected, let alone exalted by God
Inasg_no: how old are you anon
Anon_with_mute_powers: so no, i am not "the original christian"
Iglosnat: Jesus was privileged
Anon_with_mute_powers: yeah, it sorta comes with the whole being God thing
Iglosnat: opr being the son of it
Anon_with_mute_powers: the Son is not the Father, but both the Father and the Son are God
Anon_with_mute_powers: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-compact.svg
Dtrump: different interpations
Iglosnat: actual words from the creed of Nicara were not sacrosant. ...it's central theological idea that the son is God in the same way that the father is God...homoousion (of one substance with the father) expressed this theological idea https://books.google.ro/books?id=iW1-JImrwQUC&pg=PR7&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=2#v=onepage&q=son&f=false
Dtrump: the nicene creed?
Iglosnat: Nicaea*

Keigo: Stop fucking verbally abusing me
Keigo: I'm already abused by my parents I don't need you to do it too
Anon_with_mute_powers: then stop being abusive
Anon_with_mute_powers: parrot carrot
Iglosnat: Hitler38: Is a good man
Dtrump: Anon stop talking to her.
Inasg_no: I'm sorry baby I have to 
Anon_with_mute_powers: Perra cállate, rump
Keigo: I'm half deaf because of them and you say I'm abusive
Iglosnat: maybe we should stop talking in general
Inasg_no: agreed iglo xd 
Anon_with_mute_powers: some of you sure should xD
Inasg_no: like you 
Anon_with_mute_powers: less talking, more listening - and especially more thinking critically before opening the mouth
Keigo: Ignored Anon_with_mute_powers and their alts.
Anon_with_mute_powers: lest you embarrass yourself further
Iglosnat: and reexamine everything as a 14-year-old in a lobby chat
Anon_with_mute_powers: like kiki just did
Anonone: Can we all just agree to ignore  mute 
Inasg_no: what the fuck is your problem anon? You can clearly tell she's struggling rn, and she's 14. You're fucking pathetic arguing with her. You could have a go at literally anyone else in this chat so leave her the fuck alone oml
Keigo: Already done
Anonone: Good
Iglosnat: idk hes just an open-inded christian
Keigo: You can shut the fuck up too

Inasg_no: okay I gtg now 
Keigo: Ly bye
Inasg_no: bye yall ly
Anonone: Cya
Anon_with_mute_powers: go take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror and think about who you are as a person
Keigo: I'd go but we both know I'll come back later
Iglosnat: a minor
Oofalladeez: Love you tay!
Dtrump: I know im a loser but I accept it.
Iglosnat: respect woman with periods or shes too mad
Anon_with_mute_powers: wish youd try to improve instead of becoming so reveling in your state tho
Iglosnat: Me? Or having period?
Anon_with_mute_powers: i mean its not like improving is very challenging in your present state
Anon_with_mute_powers: no the dumbass in blue
Iglosnat: dark-blue*
Anon_with_mute_powers: the one in democrat colors with republican name
Anon_with_mute_powers: double oof
Dtrump: Wait my name is blue?
Keigo: Yea
Iglosnat: Color Themes Name Colors: On
Dtrump: I never realized that till now.
Keigo: L
Iglosnat: fr?
Anon_with_mute_powers: probably not
Iglosnat: yet red alos represents socialism and blue classical conservatism so
Coconacon: https://picturecards.online/static/index.html?game=UHTS
Dtrump: thats mind blowing
Anon_with_mute_powers: red for communism, there is a case to be made, yes
Anon_with_mute_powers: but blue for classical conservatism?
Anon_with_mute_powers: do you have any examples?
Iglosnat: yeah. I learned like that in school
Iglosnat: and yellow is liberalism
Iglosnat: so dark-blue isnt that much a bad choice globally
Dtrump: red is republican blue is democrat
Anon_with_mute_powers: hmm, seems like they just took the uk colors for labor, torries and libdems
Anon_with_mute_powers: not really very... generally applicable
Iglosnat: still weird that red is republican despite the entire Soveit Union being red
Anon_with_mute_powers: well yeah and no
Anon_with_mute_powers: red is a nice color
Anon_with_mute_powers: why let some commies ruin it for everyone
Dtrump: red means blood to me
Iglosnat: communism was dark-red first before the americans switched it in 1950s no?
Anon_with_mute_powers: like with the rainbow: just because some degenerate clowns use it doesnt mean it isnt the sign of God's covenant to Noah
Keigo: The FCC won't let me be you, let me be me, so let me see if you try to set me down on MTV, but it's so empty without Mommy definitely to get ready, you should get ready, you should get it earlier, just sit on my lawsuit, f*** y**, Debi 
Iglosnat: It was early October, 1976, the month before the map was to debut—live—on election night. At the urging of anchor John Chancellor, NBC had constructed the behemoth map to illustrate, in vivid blue and red, which states supported Republican incumbent Gerald Ford and which backed Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-republicans-were-blue-and-democrats-were-red-104176297/
Anon_with_mute_powers: Debbie isnt online rn, try again later
Anon_with_mute_powers: interesting, 76. thats more recent than i would have guessed
Iglosnat: “I just decided red begins with ‘r,’ Republican begins with ‘r.’ It was a more natural association,” said Archie Tse, senior graphics editor for the Times. “There wasn’t much discussion about it.”
Iglosnat: “There are two general reasons why blue for Republican and Red for Democrat make the most sense: connotation and practice,” Bensen wrote. 
Anon_with_mute_powers: i wonder if giving the whigs yellow, is also a more recent retroactive choice
Iglosnat: "cooler color blue more closely represented the rational thinker and cold-hearted and the hotter red more closely represented the passionate and hot-blooded. "
Iglosnat: ed was also the color most associated with socialism and the party of the Democrats was clearly the more socialistic of the two major parties.
Coconacon: https://picturecards.online/static/index.html?game=AWTT
Dtrump: what color is the green party?
Anon_with_mute_powers: surprising green
Anon_with_mute_powers: surprisingly*
Iglosnat: hmmmm... possibilly pink for being progressives
Anonone: We team or zoom
Keigo: We
Anonone: Oop
Anonone: Ok
Iglosnat: Tonalddrump is Host in "Spiel" if someone cares
Anon_with_mute_powers: ??
Iglosnat: idk funny coicidence
Iglosnat: Christian71 = Anon_with_mute_powers
Tonalddrump = Dtrump
Anon_with_mute_powers: whence the 71?
Iglosnat: also a christian possibly?
Anon_with_mute_powers: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(U.S._politics)#Current_U.S._third_parties

so many parties, so little choice...
Iglosnat: unironic christians in azala is rare
Anon_with_mute_powers: we seem them from time to time, or used to
Anon_with_mute_powers: dumbasses keep running them off
Iglosnat: who?
Anon_with_mute_powers: which?
Iglosnat: Dtrump's color is fitting to conservatives globally
Dtrump: everyone has some sort of religious background
Iglosnat: sad that even colors are politizied now
Anon_with_mute_powers: only if you let them be :)
Iglosnat: like us
Iglosnat: or the word "us" as USA
Iglosnat: or pre-politics Trump
Anon_with_mute_powers: us is a lost cause shit hole
Anon_with_mute_powers: 1913 was the point of no return, its just gotten worse from there
Iglosnat: The South even more
Dtrump: the south is very conservative 
Iglosnat: even a compass direction got associated with slavery in 19th century
Anon_with_mute_powers: slavery, how progressive... 
Iglosnat: abolitionists are the true traditionists
Anon_with_mute_powers: hear hear
Oofalladeez: I miss tay already

Izzy_blight: Hm. I thought he was just being paranoid like always
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh that's also possible
Ect17: I understand his dad. Everything affects everyone somehow
Ect17: Its the Butterfly Effect.
Ect17: How many time-travel-episodes do you have to watch to get it?
Bigstringbuddy: E
Ect17: The importance of Izzy's dad, is unmeasurable.
Izzy_blight: He is the main character 
Ect17: He's the reason why you were born.
Izzy_blight: I wish he'd used a condom
Ect17: Hah
Ect17: Does Assmaster know what he's posting?
Editable: yeah like you could insert every random thing which is somewhat legal near Assmaster: and it would still be the same
Ect17: You mean socially acceptable?
Ect17: Who even cares of law? If you like weed, you smoke it. Masturbation was banned in my company for some reason. Guess how that turned out
Editable: Productivity-reasons
Ect17: Some threaten it with police but they're hypocritical when it comes down to itself and taxes
Editable: Crossing red lights = Bye, bye citizen
Ect17: The legal system does not care about you
Assmaster: you do know its from a tv show and not real right?
Editable: You know that everything you do and post right now will be forgotten in 1 week
Assmaster: no shit sherlock

Aids69: Having a wife is complicated. I hate creating another family
Aids69: We are already 8 billion and there's more than enough homeless ppl and children waiting to be adopted
Aids69: we only create more children of the fear of competition 
Assmaster: https://i.postimg.cc/G3q7PXQG/noise.jpg
Dtrump: no?
Izzy_blight: gay Byron
Aids69: The more humans a country has, the stronger it gets. Both military and workforces. This is the true reason of family-propaganda, fear that someone else might have more children to crush your family down
Assmaster: https://i.postimg.cc/V6s9dc2T/7c2c445547bfdc726b7182ab66037430-png.webp
Aids69: Children are annoying. They cost, eat, spread deceases and take your energy and free time. Having kids adds no value, even dimishes it
Aids69: Your wife isn't better. She puts you more down once the honeymoon-phase is over. Evolution tricks us for their process themself.
Kittenflavored: :o
Dtrump: huh
Aids69: Why are you even american or *insert nationality*? Does your life became better after being proud of it?
Aids69: I am just drunk.
Aids69: My parents never thought of anything as they created me really
Aids69: Its funny how life goes. Some day.... Everything you thought you deserved it.... is taken away
Aids69: And then there's war... which you have no control over. A bomb drops your house and ... *ends*
Aids69: Mommy. Daddy. Where are you? But nobody came.
Vulpix_axel: Hm/
Aids69: And now, after being in a developed country, the Media is telling me how nice this world could be if they're nice too.

Toxic_love: Anyone up¿
Ishipwillowandhunter: yes. barely
Toxic_love: Tsup
Toxic_love: hru¿
Ishipwillowandhunter: hey baby. I'm doing good but bouta pass out
Toxic_love: then go sleep
Ishipwillowandhunter: can't. I mean I can but I won't
Toxic_love: i know the feeling
Toxic_love: stress is keeping me awake
Ishipwillowandhunter: The ghosts of my past haunt me with bad memories and regrets that make me sick to my stomach
Toxic_love: i used to think that things would be alright in the end and for a long time things were ok I had reached some sort of… normalcy I guess… but then I started losing those I thought cared and now I can’t help but feel completely alone now it’s just too much to handle 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You always have someone who cares, Spencer. Life is hard. People come and go. Not your fault. I get the feeling though
Toxic_love: Nobody on this site can truly say they care tbh me and my parents do nothing but fight now and my sister barely talks to me
Dtrump: I have accepted being myself.
Toxic_love: I can’t accept myself for who I am 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I truly care about you. You shouldn't have to put up with any of that shit but it happens and you don't really havea say in the matter. Im sorry baby.
Dtrump: Best way to help yourself is being alone for years.
Toxic_love: Nobody here can say that they care cuz at the end of the day I’m just a random guy on the internet 
Dtrump: Never expect anything from anyone.
Izzy_blight: As someone who was alone for most of my life. That is not true
Izzy_blight: Being alone drives you insane 
Dtrump: Then I am insane so what.
Ishipwillowandhunter: you're not just some random guy. These people can help. They can care. Our emotions are real. This being online doesn't change that.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes. Being alone is not good
Dtrump: I would rather be alone then with people.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Then that's your choice. But for most people, isolation is not a good thing. I'm deprived of phyiscal contact and for a long time I just didn't talk to people at all. Not a good thing
Toxic_love: I don’t want to be alone I just want to be left alone
Dtrump: Self-isolation is a therapy treatment.
Ishipwillowandhunter: it isn't always
Dtrump: literal therapy treatment 
Ishipwillowandhunter: alright I tried to stay up but i'm going to pass out. Tell Tay I love her and I'll talk t o her in a few hours. Goodnight loves
Toxic_love: Night mich
Toxic_love: sleep well
(anon): love you spencer. I really do care but I'm too tired to think
Toxic_love: Fair enough just get some sleep idk if ill back tomorrow so see you around ig

Izzy_bllght: uhhh... it was other other me or inner me
Toxic_love: Im confused
Izzy_bllght: oh no it was the second one they call me inner me yeah
Dtrump: Never seen them say it.
Toxic_love: Ok then
Izzy_bllght: because have you seen them talk to me just in normal chat? no they talk to me in whispers if they talked to me in normal chat then i wouldnt be able to even hold the appearance of a fake would i?
Toxic_love: Wait so if you aren’t Izzy who are you¿
Dtrump: you whisper people randomly though
Izzy_bllght: oh no one any of you guys know... well maybe Dtrump might... probably not actually 
Izzy_bllght: ... what do you mean i randomly whisper people by the way? i almost always whisper izzy at least to just say hello when i get on and they are as well
Toxic_love: That doesn’t explain anything 
Dtrump: You whispered Tay and she told you to stop.
Izzy_bllght: oh yeah that was a one time thing... i wanted to test something also im just a fake so do i really need to have a real personality?
Dtrump: not a one time thing
Izzy_bllght: well its a lot more one time than what i do with izzy 
Dtrump: This the most you have talked.
Izzy_bllght: well have you guys actually tried to talk to me?
Dtrump: Probably cuz they dont like you.
Toxic_love: I’ll talk to anyone
Izzy_bllght: eh i mean axel liked me at first havent talked to them in a while though... and izzy likes me good enough and its not like people are actively telling me to stop so why should i stop?
Izzy_bllght: ooo speaking of axel didnt they get a new account?

Toxic_love: They said you might know em so…
Izzy_bllght: i do? well i mean i have been talking to you guys... for about a few months, though if you mean you think im someone you know i highly doubt it... havent been on my actual main account since early 2021 and also i never knew Dtrump friendly in any way just saying i might have met them on a off handed chance

Izzy_bllght: yeah i was one of the johns you are right
Izzy_bllght: but i doubt you remember the actual john i am heh
Dtrump: john_f_kenny
Izzy_bllght: ... 
Izzy_bllght: are you sure you arent some sort of guy with a magical memory?
Dtrump: I do have a good memory.
Toxic_love: Ok…
Izzy_bllght: well i doubt you do actually remember me full but how do you remember how you actually know me? because i only thought you knew me after i remember you were close with... some sort of one of the admins or something i dont know
Dtrump: What?
Izzy_bllght: do you remember anything about me or how we even met besides my name? just curious because i havent actually talked to anyone who knew me in... a long while
Dtrump: So you are a different person?
Izzy_bllght: i dont understand the question
Dtrump: john_f_kenny or different person?
Izzy_bllght: oh no i am him thats my main account and actually my first one!... well techinally my actual first account got stolen because i didnt put a password on it

Person112: Good to know Grace
Person112: Ndsnhs
Shushiboo: Yeah, just throw me out in 12 foot of water and ill probably drown, very easy to kill me
Person112: Honestly same, or throw me down a really long water slide and once I get into the end at the water I'd probably already pissed my pants Then I'll be so shooken. I'll probably drown myself
Shushiboo: Awh poor zachary
Shushiboo: Dw I won't let you die, the gingers have to stick together
Ishipwillowandhunter: I just swim to the edge of the pool and hangs on if I really need to. The panic of drowning sucks but like if I could just accept it and die at the bottom of a pool, sounds nice 
Shushiboo: Exactly mich

Gnome3: https://i.postimg.cc/3Jmr2QkR/Izzy41sgame2023-07-08-172441.png
Gnome3: This game is full https://picturecards.online/static/index.html?game=FCLH
Gnome3: Threatened me to gas smh. Cringe nazi vs Stronk almost-succesful native american genocide
Izzy_blight: True. Based
Gnome3: Yes. Izzy41 is german with others and host of Izzy69.
Izzy_blight: Germans are so sexy
Gnome3: Do you think germans have one of most boomer attitudes. Like it was 80 year ago and just one aspect of their history. How often do they want to joke about nazis again?
Gnome3: Americans are more diverse than this
Izzy_blight: Well it was a pretty big aspect of modern history. And it's easy to milk for edgy shock humor
Izzy_blight: Plus lampshading and self deprecating your country is cool
Gnome3: but it gets old and desperate.
Izzy_blight: It does, certainly. Nobody really cares though
Gnome3: saying "This is a restricted zone", banning me after it becomes private, I see this as a bad dry joke
Gnome3: Their fault for being framed as still-nazis
Izzy_blight: Welcome to the internet. Everyone is a brain dead gremlin lacking higher brain functions
Izzy_blight: Isn't it fun 
Gnome3: Mrzone: Verlassen
Mrzone: sie den gesicherten
Mrzone: Bereich
Nimiaki: Verlassen sie sofort den gesicherten Bereich.
Nimiaki: Ansonsten wird Gas freigesetzt.
Gnome3: lol just to judge for eevryone
Izzy_blight: Lol funny gas chamber joke haha.
Gnome3: it wasnt secured at all, sir :P
Izzy_blight: So funny I fell and broke my hand
Gnome3: you arent mad that their leader has your name on it?
Gnome3: Izzy41
Izzy_blight: Nah, it's cool. It's like when you see someone with your name in a movie, you just point and go "hey its me"
Gnome3: except they can ruin your name but ok
Izzy_blight: I have no reputation to uphold
Dtrump: izzy is a popular name
Izzy_blight: Most girls named Izzy are nuts for some reason
Izzy_blight: Me included 
Dtrump: maybe it is because its a hispanic name
Izzy_blight: Mi amor
Izzy_blight: Mi Jimmy
Izzy_blight: No me gusto
