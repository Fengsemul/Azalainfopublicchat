Farfignewton: Moral of the start don't try to muscle out a fart just let it happen
Farfignewton: learn from my mistakes I share my trauma so that all may learn the lesson without themselves knowing the shame
Farfignewton: oh the shame
Djshrimpdick: you should never push
Farfignewton: I bore down too hard once while actually pooping on the toilet and blew my fucking o-ring
Farfignewton: I heard AND felt it tear omg it was crazy
Djshrimpdick: gross
Farfignewton: it hurt so much I started barfing so it was just crazy awfulness coming out of both ends of me and the bathroom looked like a slaughterhouse
Djshrimpdick: ew
Farfignewton: and then I slid in the poobarf and bruised my tailbone on the tile
Farfignewton: At that point I started weeping
Djshrimpdick: i weep for you
Farfignewton: because the only way it could get worse was if a bunch of horny rapists high on PCP burst into my bathroom and sodomized me in my tortured asshole
Farfignewton: so.......funny thing about the universe......don't dare it
Djshrimpdick: yea that would be worse
Farfignewton: it was thoroughly worse
Farfignewton: once that was done I attempted self-deletion but I pussied out and passed out instead

Ishipwillowandhunter: No but you can taste my cock
Ishipwillowandhunter: Jimmy stop touching your daughter and come hold her
Ishipwillowandhunter: Time for our daily reminder
Ishipwillowandhunter: (anon): Imagine having her thighs pressed to the side of your head. Her body squirming beneath you as she lifts up, desperately grinding her clit against your tongue, whining and moaning as they get closer and closer, so desperate for me to let them cum.
Izzy_blight: No I would rather not
Izzy_blight: Actually I changed my mind 
Ishipwillowandhunter: So you do or don't want it? Most of what I wrote isn't exactly vanilla 
Izzy_blight: Eh not that far from it
Ishipwillowandhunter: Alright, smut(?) Incoming
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): I want to edge you. I want to touch and tease all of your pretty little body, making you feel so good, making you get so close to the edge before stopping. I want to edge you over, and over, and over again while you're tied up until you're a crying, sensitive, desperate whore. And when I finally do let you cum, I'm going to continue using you, filling you with my cum repeatedly until you can't take it anymore, your overstimulated body writhing at the smallest touch.
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): I'm sure you'd also look so cute with a collar and leash, don't you think? Ordering you around, making you obey like the mindless little whore you are.
Ishipwillowandhunter: (anon): Thigh grinding though. Having my pretty girl get so desperate she sits on my leg, grinding herself against my thigh, her arms wrapping around my neck as she shudders and moans, her hips rocking in desperation as she get closer and closer to cumming. So needy, so desperate for my attention and help. So pathetic.
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): I think you'd look so pretty with a collar and leash around your throat. So eager to obey but so happy to be disciplined. Every time you step out of line, you're going to be punished. I am going to ruin your body until I have you trained. Making you wear your collar even in public so everyone knows who you belong to.
Ishipwillowandhunter: (anon): I want to leave red marks all over your ass, I want to leave it stinging, the tears running down your face, your body sore so that whenever you sit down, you feel what I did to you and you remember who the fuck owns you.
Izzy_blight: Jesus cocaine Christ
Ishipwillowandhunter: (anon): Holding you in place, forcing you to look at me as you whine and moan, your body writhing as I bring you to the edge, stopping it each and every time because I like to see just how much I can ruin you. I want to leave my marks on your body, in plain sight so everyone can see just what it means to belong to me. So they can see that you're not as innocent as they thought you were. 
Ishipwillowandhunter: (anon): It's so adorable. You act so innocent, so sure of yourself but you know how badly you want to be treated like the worthless slut you are. When I have you tied up, my  cock pounding your pussy, my hand wrapped around your throat, stifling those pretty noises coming out of your mouth as I ruin you, you will know who you belong to
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): So eager, are we? Don't worry pet, that'll come soon enough. I haven't had enough fun with you yet. Though that would be fun, having you on your knees, completely submitting to me. No thoughts running through that mind of yours except the ones I put in there. Don't ever forget that you're only here to please me. I will use you however I see fit. I will leave you aching and begging for more, and as long as you're good for me, you'll get it.
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): Sitting my pretty little sub on my lap, grabbing them by their throat and forcing them to look at me as I finger them. Making you cum for me over and over, the tears streaming down your face as your body shakes. Tell me, pet, how are you ever going to handle my cock if you can't even handle my fingers? So fucking pathetic.
Ishipwillowandhunter: (anon): I want to fuck you until you've lost count of how many times you've came for me. I want to make you a whining, begging mess, do desperate for an end but I don't stop until I'm done using each and every part of your body, treating you like the pretty little whore you are.
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): I'd make you beg for it too. I want to hear the desperate pleas for more come out of your mouth. I want to know what you want but make you beg for it like a desperate slut anyway. The pretty sounds you make as I tease you, use you, hurt you. All for my pleasure.
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): A nice little collar around their throat, ropes wrapped around their wrist and ankles, tied and completely at my mercy. I like to blindfold them, I want them to be afraid and excited, not knowing how I'm going to use that pretty little body next. 
Inasg_no: back 
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): Imagine having her thighs pressed to the side of your head. Her body squirming beneath you as she lifts up, desperately grinding her clit against your tongue, whining and moaning as they get closer and closer, so desperate for me to let them cum.
Inasg_no: oh for fuck sake now I'm hornier than ever :( 
Ishipwillowandhunter: anon): I want to leave red marks all over your ass, I want to leave it stinging, the tears running down your face, your body sore so that whenever you sit down, you feel what I did to you and you remember who the fuck owns you.
Inasg_no: stopppp
Inasg_no: It's turning me on so bad 
Inasg_no: fuck im horny 
Izzy_blight: Some of this is really hot but most of it makes me feel really bad
Ishipwillowandhunter: Alright Izzy, should be enough. Like I said not exactly vanilla but I hope you enjoy. Do tell me what you think of my 1am horny writing
