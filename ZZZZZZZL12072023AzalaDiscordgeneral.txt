I finally finished scrolling. What year is it?


[01/29/2017 10:31 PM] xenunnaki
I'm not sure why this server was made to begin with, since the lack of multiple channels means everything is a single conversation here


[01/29/2017 10:31 PM] xenunnaki
it might as well be the general Chat window in Cah itself

Do pineapples only wearbathrobes on special occasions? Are they monagrammed?


[03/22/2017 6:08 AM] American_Reject#1541
Pineapples are *very* particular about when they wear bathrobes. They wear them mostly to The Legion of Pineapple meetings which are held deep underground which is why they're rarely seen. They also wear them to royal pineapple births. They aren't monogrammed because they need to keep their identities a secret and that would make it quite difficult.

What are the pineapples position on pineapples on pizaa?


[03/22/2017 6:10 AM] American_Reject#1541
Well seeing as their own kind is being slaughtered and eaten I would say they are strongly against pineapple on pizza.

Do they consider regual apples as lesser beings?


[03/22/2017 6:12 AM] American_Reject#1541
They have no direct association with apples, but yes they do.

Why don't they make shower robes? I rarely take baths

Maybe they don't make shower robes because if they exist bathrobes won't be used anymore

It's a secret conspiracy by the bathrobe industry to keep showerrobes from ever coming out.


[03/23/2017 3:34 AM] American_Reject#1541
We should invest in this


[03/23/2017 3:35 AM] Deleted User
The bathrobe industry will assinate us. They probably already have bathrobed agents on their way.


[03/23/2017 4:01 AM] American_Reject#1541
Then we'll have to go underground


[03/23/2017 4:02 AM] Deleted User
But then we'll get dirty and have to take showers and the bathrobe gestapo will be on us. Their power is immeasurable.

Considering I think 10 Tylenol can kill you, if I crushed 20 and put it in a strong drink it might work, then I could cut her limbs off and feed her to various animals. I'm extremely good at cleaning blood off of things

why doesnt the deck veiver pull up players names anymore?


[05/05/2017 1:04 PM] qiqi_impact
@Brown_sugar fixed, search works by player names now


[05/05/2017 6:09 PM] qiqi_impact
does anyone use a phone and prefer the normal view to the mobile view?


[05/05/2017 6:19 PM] Ariana#1051
i do @Qiqi Impact


[05/05/2017 6:30 PM] qiqi_impact
@Ariana it is anything wrong with the mobile view that can be fixed?


[05/05/2017 6:44 PM] Ariana#1051
@Qiqi Impact Mmm i think i just like seeing both the chat and game at the same time...but hey no problems


[05/05/2017 6:49 PM] qiqi_impact
would either of these work:
A) top half game, bottom half chat, or
B) a chat window that slides in from the side


[05/05/2017 6:52 PM] Ariana#1051
B sounds good because you can just slide it when you need to play the  game and slide back when needed..hassle free

figured


[05/22/2017 3:09 AM] smelt
i run a server for the game dev of tough coded live iv (littlenando) and i test so mutch stuff on that server so i basicly know discord like the back of my hand now


[05/22/2017 3:10 AM] smelt
and am admin on 3 other servers


[05/22/2017 3:10 AM] harbey1
Well azala if you need help making the server better you have people at the ready


[05/22/2017 3:10 AM] smelt
its cringy to look at a server with nothing added or anything


[05/22/2017 3:17 AM] smelt
dm me azala if you want help maybe making the server looking a bit more presentable


[05/22/2017 3:17 AM] smelt
i could think of some ideas


[05/22/2017 3:17 AM] smelt
even a few simple ones


[05/22/2017 4:52 AM] qiqi_impact
every dumbass in the world has ideas


[05/22/2017 4:52 AM] qiqi_impact
why dont you put the ideas down here and we can go over them


[05/22/2017 4:52 AM] qiqi_impact
hate to be a dick but the last 3 people who said something similar were basically retarded


[05/22/2017 4:53 AM] smelt

[05/22/2017 4:53 AM] smelt
ill think of some changes and then post them later im playing well azala rn


[05/22/2017 4:53 AM] qiqi_impact
souds good


[05/22/2017 4:54 AM] smelt
i get why you could be sceptical


[05/22/2017 8:23 AM] smelt
the thing is to make a good discord server i need to know bounderies and whats going to be happening in the future tho


[05/22/2017 8:23 AM] smelt
ill ask you on a later time


[05/22/2017 8:23 AM] smelt
one main thing is how interactive you want this server to be


[05/22/2017 8:26 AM] qiqi_impact
not very


[05/22/2017 8:26 AM] qiqi_impact
total minimalist approach


[05/22/2017 1:16 PM] _genghisbong
:E


[05/22/2017 3:04 PM] smelt
well if your doing minimalist than really all i can think of is maybe make a second chat for screenshots of the game that are funny


[05/22/2017 3:08 PM] qiqi_impact
people will post porn


[05/22/2017 3:08 PM] qiqi_impact

[05/23/2017 7:21 PM] ryanthebuizel
Is that near Delaware?


[05/23/2017 7:21 PM] grimmestgrievous
Just that my borough is small


[05/23/2017 7:22 PM] grimmestgrievous
small enough to have no place to put a separate middle school


[05/23/2017 7:22 PM] grimmestgrievous
Heck my Middle Senior High School was in a different township.


[05/23/2017 7:22 PM] grimmestgrievous
Not that it meant anything, half the township is forest.

@Qiqi Impact The blank card typing box is the same color as the background until you click on it to type. It's hard to see or notice it there

[05/28/2017 10:04 AM] qiqi_impact
@Deleted User what color should it be


[05/28/2017 10:06 AM] qiqi_impact
actually you know what - i can do it like scrollbars, either a 50% black or white tint based on the background color


[05/28/2017 5:11 PM] spleen#6500
i dont know if anyone else has this problem but since the ui update at the start of every round it shifts focus to the box used for typing blank cards


[05/28/2017 5:12 PM] spleen#6500
so you will be typing in chat and suddenly continue typing in the text box for typing blank cards


[05/28/2017 5:17 PM] spleen#6500
on mobile and pc

@Qiqi Impact I have a small bit of feedback about the new layout on the site


[06/07/2017 1:01 AM] qiqi_impact
go for it


[06/07/2017 1:02 AM] ballad
I know my opinion probably matters very little, if at all, to you, but I kinda like the other version better, there's more lines and stuff


[06/07/2017 1:02 AM] ballad
Hard to explain


[06/07/2017 1:02 AM] qiqi_impact
more lines


[06/07/2017 1:02 AM] ballad
Lines


[06/07/2017 1:02 AM] ballad
Yes


[06/07/2017 1:02 AM] ballad
Idk how to English


[06/07/2017 1:03 AM] qiqi_impact
there's no going back. but if you can come up with a specific improvement to the new layout I can probably put it in.


[06/07/2017 1:03 AM] ballad
Okay so you know the chat window thing....


[06/07/2017 1:03 AM] qiqi_impact
k


[06/07/2017 1:03 AM] ballad
Like a separating border or line between the actual window and the game itself


[06/07/2017 1:04 AM] qiqi_impact
sure, ill do that


[06/07/2017 1:04 AM] ballad
Thanks man


[06/07/2017 1:13 AM] qiqi_impact
I'll be honest. I tried it out locally with a 1px border, 2px border, and a faint shadow. All three look way uglier than it currently looks.


[06/07/2017 1:13 AM] qiqi_impact
I'll ask a bunch of people in the big public games what they think. If they overwhelmingly want the line, I can reconsider.

[06/08/2017 7:00 AM] ganzir
"One of its biggest criticisms is that inmates usually remain for years (and sometimes decades) on death row without ever actually being informed of the date of their execution prior to the date itself, so inmates suffer due to the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not any given day will be their last. According to Amnesty International, the intense and prolonged stress means many inmates on death row have poor mental health, suffering from the so-called death row phenomenon."

[06/23/2017 12:05 AM] qiqi_impact

[06/23/2017 12:05 AM] qiqi_impact
you log in


[06/23/2017 12:05 AM] qiqi_impact
then enter a name in the giant box in the middle of the screen


[06/23/2017 12:10 AM] qiqi_impact
(how did you manage to find the discord link hidden in the contact form before trying to enter a player name which is in the middle of the screen)


[06/23/2017 12:16 AM] qiqi_impact
I suppose when you're looking for a game, you're thinking "game game game wait there's no game, uh, menu, contact, how do i do this?"


[06/23/2017 12:16 AM] qiqi_impact
So I'll have to stick some "game" language somewhere on the login page so it is clear you pick that after picking a player name.

At a certain point I'll have to cut it off and say "nope. you can't figure this out, I'm not idiotproofing it for you in the interface"


[06/29/2017 12:09 AM] midnight_sylph
If you can't figure it out how do you know how to use a computer phone etc.


[06/29/2017 12:09 AM] qiqi_impact
you can use a phone by clicking random things

@Qiqi Impact someone mentioned they wish azala.info had an app so they could see which of their friends was playing it on Discord. Seems likle a good idea though I understand it would be a lot of work.


[07/12/2017 8:18 AM] qiqi_impact
@Deleted User yeah that's a lot of work, wont happen. but you should be able to set your discord game to w/e you want, right?

"idiotproofed" is a generic term for "guard against unexpected user behavior" and not me calling you an idiot, because you're not an idiot

I had a brilliant idea a while back. Did you know that Steam will offer refunds on any game you buy within a week of purchase?


[10/30/2017 1:09 AM] ganzir
Here's what you do:
1. Buy all the games you want
2. Download them onto another computer or virtual machine
3. Cut that comp/VM's internet connection
4. Return all the games you bought, for a full refund
5. Play them
Obviously this only works for offline games. You'll be able to play them in offline mode, and that machine's instance of Steam won't know that you no longer own the games.


[10/30/2017 1:23 AM] pokebeast2
What you're talking about there is VERY illegal and against the Steam ToS. They can terminate your account if caught


[10/30/2017 5:16 AM] RailRoad Engie#6709
Plus, isnt the way steam launches games is using a url?


[10/30/2017 3:46 PM] qiqi_impact
steam will block you if you attempt a mass refund


[10/30/2017 3:47 PM] qiqi_impact
remember, the refund side is still online, so steam can check your usage against fraud patterns


[10/31/2017 4:02 AM] ganzir
Wait a minute. Are you implying that somebody else had the same idea, before I did, and Steam has implemented countermeasures against it?

This German streamer did a live stream on the game and now all the people who watch him are playing the game

i cant because its always full and it sucks and i dont want to donate money that i dont have


[03/03/2018 11:10 PM] lum1ty
Maybe check if someone in the community is rich and willing, as only one participant needs to have donated


[03/03/2018 11:11 PM] lum1ty
Or you can open the page slightly early before the event, and let the waitlist clear out on its own

nevermind


[04/07/2018 8:04 AM] spenguin
i was meaning how many people period can your servers handle because i know the limit is 20 per game and 35 games only


[04/07/2018 8:09 AM] qiqi_impact
the 20 is a bit arbitrary - pretty sure I can do more, but 20-player games really suck to play in anyway


[04/07/2018 8:12 AM] qiqi_impact
the 35 game limit used to be a technical limitation, but now it's essentially a "free most of the time, but still makes money at peak hours" value.

@Graboid Consider deleting all your double-blank questions in Sexually_frustrated - watching streamers play CAH, your doubles play so poorly that I'm considering copying your deck, taking them out, and putting that one in the defaults instead of SF.

Azala man it‚Äôs ya boy Fallen_king back at it again - did you ever think that you‚Äôd blow up like you did? I remember back in 2016 where you were lucky if you could find anyone you knew online, now it‚Äôs just plump full of people all the time. Was this much success ever on your mind?


[08/30/2018 1:50 AM] qiqi_impact
I thought it would take over a bit quicker. I now understand the value of endorsements from famous people - a game that people would easily dismiss all of a sudden becomes interesting once their favorite youtuber plays it.


[08/30/2018 11:03 AM] ballad
Yeah, makes sense when you really think about it

So I have noticed lately that the number of possible games at once keeps getting smaller, is there a reason for this?


[09/16/2018 4:17 AM] jl_momo
I assume server cost?

[09/16/2018 4:21 AM] jl_momo
I noticed sometime back when I first used the site for weekly CAH after Pretend your xizzy went down that it had like 140 slots, and generally wait times weren't too bad. But it seems to continue to shrink and is currently down to 40/40 with long waits.

[09/16/2018 4:27 AM] Deleted User
You could probably run similar specs for like,10 bucks a month


[09/16/2018 4:27 AM] Deleted User
and the cost goes down with little use, and goes up in very affordably small amounts with major use, it scales with your apps, hence the name


[09/16/2018 4:28 AM] qiqi_impact
probably. how are they when it comes to blowing up instances?

[09/16/2018 4:31 AM] jl_momo
Glad that I asked, more so. As while my money is currently tight. I actually really do like some of the features of website compared to others.


[09/16/2018 4:31 AM] Deleted User
all of that is running and my rtm is on data.aeternum.network so you can go see performance.


[09/16/2018 4:32 AM] Deleted User
Right now everythings idle, havent had time to do much recently, so its price is dropping down to about 10 bucks a month and im not really losing performance. It desnt really make sense from a business standpoint. But they do it anwyays


[09/16/2018 4:32 AM] Deleted User
And it works


[09/16/2018 4:32 AM] Deleted User
so whatever


[09/16/2018 4:33 AM] qiqi_impact
what do you mean - your cost scales to usage?


[09/16/2018 4:33 AM] jl_momo
I assume you have a monthly max, and if you use less than that for a lengthy amont of time they charge you less.


[09/16/2018 4:33 AM] jl_momo
Well monthly max and min


[09/16/2018 4:33 AM] Deleted User
They charge for hourly full usage


[09/16/2018 4:33 AM] qiqi_impact
ah


[09/16/2018 4:34 AM] Deleted User
and then if you arent using yoru servers full specs, they drop teh price, i assume is a massivly complicated shared hosting setup


[09/16/2018 4:34 AM] Deleted User
but the performance doesnt feel like it is.

Eitherway glad I brought it up, because even non-scaling you could likely find much better rates or at least gain much more resources for the same cost

Mostly I just wanna know if it's actually funny or if it's just the weed


[10/01/2018 7:55 AM] qiqi_impact
@Graboid it's good enough. I'm not picky about answer cards. It's the question cards that need to be vetted carefully.


[10/01/2018 7:56 AM] qiqi_impact
One bad answer can just be thrown away, but one bad question can kill the mood of a game (even if it can be skipped) because all of a sudden everyone has to debate whether or not to skip the card.

[10/04/2018 7:41 PM] pennythedullahan
do donater games add to the games limit, or are they a separate entity


[10/04/2018 7:45 PM] pennythedullahan
and is it possible to set up a separate donater account for use on a server that runs daily games for a dedicated discord/subreddit?


[10/05/2018 12:50 AM] qiqi_impact
@Penny the Dullahan
"do donater games add to the games limit" - yes
"is it possible to set up a separate donater account for use on a server that runs daily games for a dedicated discord/subreddit?" - 1 donation = 1 name. I can rename your existing account if you want

or show more cards on one page?


[10/20/2018 11:29 PM] qiqi_impact
@CaptainDelicious Not at the moment. Having "see all cards" for a deck with thousands of cards is an expensive query and must be broken into pieces.

Why do you need it? I could think of a solution tailored to your use case.


[10/20/2018 11:30 PM] _captaindelicious
my friends are coming over next weekend and we would love to print out our selfmade deck to play


[10/20/2018 11:34 PM] qiqi_impact
yeah, just copy-paste the 16 at a time for now - if you need a printed deck, your best bet is to manage your deck in a separate doc file locally. that way you don't have to worry about losing data, etc. online.

More brain-dead email feedback:


[11/11/2018 7:14 PM] qiqi_impact
"I paid to never wait again and I am having to wait?"
> (never even tried joining a game)


[11/11/2018 11:47 PM] qiqi_impact
it turns out this idiot clicked "Invite Code" instead of "New Game", typed 4 random letters, and wondered why it didn't make a game


[11/11/2018 11:49 PM] qiqi_impact
the question is - do I make a UI change to accomodate this level of retardation, or do I just leave it as is


[11/12/2018 1:43 AM] Deleted User
Ui change.


[11/12/2018 1:44 AM] Deleted User
You don't have to make significant changes, and he paid for premium. Shrug.


[11/12/2018 5:56 AM] qiqi_impact
I ended up adding text "Did the Host give you a 4-letter code?" to just under the invite code button, not too intrusive and gives a clearer indication that you have taken a wrong turn if you instead wanted new/join game


[11/12/2018 5:56 AM] qiqi_impact
sure, 99% are not going to need it, but, well...

Hi, what does the site run on and why is there a max number of games?


[11/14/2018 12:41 AM] qiqi_impact
@artyknots a tiny linode instance and it does two things - puts an upper bound on CPU/memory resources and is a good monetization technique

[11/17/2018 7:03 PM] qiqi_impact
@Bandorin no way that is possible, I'll look into it though


[11/17/2018 7:03 PM] qiqi_impact
I'm guessing it's a typo on the account name


[11/17/2018 7:03 PM] bandorin
Might be that I made a different account somehow


[11/17/2018 7:04 PM] qiqi_impact
not sure what's going on


[11/17/2018 7:04 PM] bandorin

[11/17/2018 7:04 PM] qiqi_impact
yeah


[11/17/2018 7:04 PM] qiqi_impact
you got a "____, thank for you for your donation"

[11/17/2018 7:06 PM] bandorin
Should it be on the paypal receipt, or would I have gotten one from no-reply@azala.info aswell?


[11/17/2018 7:06 PM] qiqi_impact
subject line


[11/17/2018 7:06 PM] qiqi_impact

when i queue up for a server, do i get disconnected after a while? or only when i have an open server to play?


[11/18/2018 6:14 PM] _captaindelicious
if im afk*


[11/18/2018 8:38 PM] qiqi_impact
@CaptainDelicious only when you have an open server, and dont do anything for 30m. if you're on the waitlist it won't d/c you.


[11/18/2018 8:40 PM] qiqi_impact
when you hit the waitlist, it will give an audio ping and give you 5 minutes to close an idle game popup (so it doesnt take the slot for an idle player)


[11/18/2018 8:42 PM] qiqi_impact
your best bet is to leave the game window open, off to the side, so you can physically see when your game is created

Chicken cards?! So he had a deck that only said "Chicken" or something?


[12/05/2018 1:54 AM] qiqi_impact
right. specifically, a "Pocket Deck" which is the kind that travels with you


[12/05/2018 1:54 AM] qiqi_impact
it's a confusing concept and no longer needed anymore now that we have blank cards and user-created decks

Hey, I'm kinda new on azala.info and have a question about creating your own decks, I hope this is the right place to ask this question and maybe someone can help me?

I mean, the creating is pretty self-explanatory, except I don't understand why there is basically one "Answer"-option and 3 "Question"-options (Q1, Q2 and Q3) you can choose from when adding a card to a deck. What's the difference between Question1, Question2 and Question3? I've basically always choose Q1 because I didn't knew what's different about the other two options (Q2 and Q3).

Sorry if this isnt the right place to ask, but I just figured discord server might be right... üòÑ


[01/28/2019 8:17 PM] cole_thatch
@philipp_amthor_memes Q1 = Question for 1(!) answer. Q2 = Question for 2(!) answers. Q3 = Question for 3(!) answers.


[01/29/2019 10:34 PM] cole_thatch
@Qiqi Impact Now I have a question of my own. Why is there a "current games"-Limit of 40 Games? Is there a possibility of set a higher amount of running games so that the waiting time for a private game isn't 3 hours or so? Except donating to get "always" a number 1 spot.

If I want to make a private room I have to wait 3 hours, donate or have atleast one friend in my group

You can no longer make a donation of exactly $30 if you've already donated. That rule is because of you.

@Eielyreith Stormwake   please explain it to me


[07/15/2019 5:04 AM] eielyreithstormwake
I tried to donate $30 to get instant access to games and it didn't register on my phone when I did it the first time so I dated a second time and it register twice


[07/15/2019 5:05 AM] darkacid_uwe
oh ok

[07/15/2019 5:05 AM] darkacid_uwe
no prob


[07/15/2019 5:06 AM] darkacid_uwe
so now we cant donate 2 times on one account


[07/15/2019 5:07 AM] eielyreithstormwake
You can just not $30 exactly


[07/15/2019 5:07 AM] qiqi_impact
You can - but not exactly $30 for the second one. It can be $30.01.


[07/15/2019 5:07 AM] darkacid_uwe
ok


[07/15/2019 5:07 AM] qiqi_impact
People do donate twice - but never exactly $30 unless it was a mistake.


[07/15/2019 5:08 AM] eielyreithstormwake
Yeah exactly


[07/15/2019 5:09 AM] eielyreithstormwake
Also @Qiqi Impact if you make a patreon and I get my money back from a gym I'll donate another $30 a month ;3


[07/15/2019 5:09 AM] eielyreithstormwake

The ability to have 9999 cards as blanks is a godsend


[07/15/2019 5:11 AM] qiqi_impact
That's awesome to hear. You can definitely get some good games out of it.

yes we love total blank playing too


[07/15/2019 5:12 AM] qiqi_impact
I don't think I'll do a Patreon. I don't really have "access tiers" in the sense that you'd usually do one.


[07/15/2019 5:14 AM] eielyreithstormwake
I have an idea


[07/15/2019 5:14 AM] eielyreithstormwake
The higher the tier the more say you have in what's updated on the website? So 1$ has barely any control but 250$ has like near god powers over it lmao you can bet people would go that high too


[07/15/2019 5:15 AM] eielyreithstormwake
Also if I save 200$ and donate it before the end of the year will you add 2 more bots? Cause me and my friend bore each other with just 3 bots lmao


[07/15/2019 5:18 AM] eielyreithstormwake
Besides just have a single tier "1$, you get access to patreon exclusive discord channels where you get to talk to me one on one" or something

This task a grueling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
Diamonds tonight
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up, total shock fills your body,
Oh no it's you again,
I could never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes,
Eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again
Just when you think you're safe, overhear some hissing from right behind,
Right, right behind
That's a nice life you have, shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time,
Time, time, time, time
Blows up, then your health bar drops, you could use a 1-up, get inside don't be tardy,
So now you're stuck in there, half a heart is left but don't die, die, die
Die, die, die, die
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all your stuff again,
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all your stuff again,
Creepers, you're mine
Dig up diamonds, and craft those diamonds and make some armor,
Get it baby, go and forge that like you so, MLG pro,
The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me bro
Training in your room under the torch light,
Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight,
Every single day and the whole night,
Creeper's out prowlin' - alright
Look at me, look at you,
Take my revenge that's what I'm gonna do,
I'm a warrior baby, what else is new,
And my blade's gonna tear through you
Bring it

i dont think it's a cache clear thing. that is really weird


[01/06/2020 7:28 AM] qiqi_impact
is it still busted on desktop for you?


[01/06/2020 7:29 AM] t0ru
im not on pc just rn


[01/06/2020 7:29 AM] t0ru
i can boot it up rq tho


[01/06/2020 7:29 AM] qiqi_impact
go for it


[01/06/2020 7:29 AM] t0ru
ight will do


[01/06/2020 7:29 AM] t0ru
could it be the browser itself?


[01/06/2020 7:29 AM] qiqi_impact
could be a million things


[01/06/2020 7:30 AM] qiqi_impact
browser, extensions, some middleman killing off websocket connections....


[01/06/2020 7:30 AM] t0ru
same issue


[01/06/2020 7:31 AM] qiqi_impact
interesting. it just says "Connecting..." under Pictures Against Humanity


[01/06/2020 7:31 AM] t0ru
it does work on chrome but for some reason not on opera which uses chrome


[01/06/2020 7:31 AM] t0ru
yeah


[01/06/2020 7:31 AM] t0ru
doesnt even say how many are in queue


[01/06/2020 7:31 AM] qiqi_impact
windows opera?


[01/06/2020 7:31 AM] t0ru
yes


[01/06/2020 7:32 AM] qiqi_impact
ill go download the browser. never tested withit


[01/06/2020 7:32 AM] t0ru
it used to work half a year back


[01/06/2020 7:32 AM] qiqi_impact
when did it stop? I've changed a lot of shit


[01/06/2020 7:33 AM] qiqi_impact
like I rewrote a ton of the frontend code, some of it might have compatibility issues with some browsers


[01/06/2020 7:33 AM] t0ru
i havent played in a very long time, so i wouldnt be able to tell


[01/06/2020 7:33 AM] qiqi_impact
k


[01/06/2020 7:34 AM] qiqi_impact
on opera, is there a "developer console" you can access? on chrome it's if you hit F12


[01/06/2020 7:34 AM] t0ru
yeah


[01/06/2020 7:34 AM] qiqi_impact
can you get in there and tell me if you see any red stuff in the console


[01/06/2020 7:34 AM] t0ru
sure


[01/06/2020 7:35 AM] qiqi_impact
wait a sec. im downloading this thing and it says "free VPN" - is that enabled for you?


[01/06/2020 7:35 AM] t0ru
nope


[01/06/2020 7:35 AM] qiqi_impact
k


[01/06/2020 7:35 AM] t0ru
ive turned that off permanently


[01/06/2020 7:35 AM] t0ru
im using nordvpn, but thats not the issue either


[01/06/2020 7:36 AM] qiqi_impact
right, because chrome is working


[01/06/2020 7:37 AM] qiqi_impact
i've got opera up and it's working for me


[01/06/2020 7:37 AM] qiqi_impact
hmm


[01/06/2020 7:38 AM] t0ru
im getting a connection error in the dev console


[01/06/2020 7:38 AM] qiqi_impact
there are no ads on the game, so that can't be an issue


[01/06/2020 7:38 AM] qiqi_impact
ah


[01/06/2020 7:38 AM] qiqi_impact

[02/25/2020 5:57 AM] Christorm747#7693
Meaning you were expecting another kind of response from your comment? I'm just guessing


[02/25/2020 5:57 AM] cgoodwin#1153
I expected worse in a server like this


[02/25/2020 5:58 AM] asianwaifu#3569
Ah that's what I thought, just double checking.
I was like "they either mean tough crowd oooor there's a room for me to go and be a lewd piece of shit"


[02/25/2020 5:58 AM] Christorm747#7693
Haha worse? I guess your right

[02/28/2020 1:56 AM] lil_cat_beans
Or send me to a mental hospital


[02/28/2020 1:56 AM] timesphobic

[02/28/2020 1:59 AM] lil_cat_beans
No. The day they find out is the day I'll either kill myself or run away.


[02/28/2020 1:59 AM] lil_cat_beans
Unless I manage to hide it until I turn 18


[02/28/2020 1:59 AM] lil_cat_beans
Then I'll just move out.


[02/28/2020 2:03 AM] Christorm747#7693
Oh your not 18 yet. Ok. Then u really are in a predicament. Well then I'm so sorry. I mean tbh I think you got to play low before your parents find out. And when they do, I think u have to face them. I really don't think they're going to kill u. But I get it though


[02/28/2020 2:05 AM] lil_cat_beans
I hate my mom so much. Shes always telling me I'm a mistake

[02/28/2020 2:13 AM] Christorm747#7693

Ok listen this took a really dark turn.  I'm just trying to help. I really do want this to go well for u. And I know you need time to think this out. I'm sorry this is happening. But just try talking to your dad. If he is supportive like u say then just try

[03/03/2020 5:49 AM] asianwaifu#3569
i got sick and puked so i texted my mom saying i didnt want to do my class at the hospital today so she got mad and took my phone because i come out without my scrubs on when she picked me up


[03/03/2020 5:49 AM] asianwaifu#3569

just a long day


[03/03/2020 5:53 AM] Christorm747#7693
Yeah see that's one thing we have in common. Definitely a long day for me too.  Not as bad as yours but gaining up on you


[03/03/2020 5:55 AM] asianwaifu#3569
yeah


[03/03/2020 5:55 AM] asianwaifu#3569
what happened during your day?


[03/03/2020 5:58 AM] Christorm747#7693
Yup. Well first I got to school and everything seemed go well when I forgot my lunch.  (I know, I know that's not bad) but with my lunch was my project for physics class. Don't ask why it was in there


[03/03/2020 5:59 AM] Christorm747#7693
I didn't want to go back home and get it because it was raining out.and since I'm a biker to school it wouldn't end well


[03/03/2020 5:59 AM] Christorm747#7693
Since I didn't have that project I failed the assignment


[03/03/2020 6:02 AM] asianwaifu#3569
oh dear


[03/03/2020 6:02 AM] Christorm747#7693
Oh but that's not it. I went to the nurses office  today and a kid was in there who may or may not have the  Corona virus


[03/03/2020 6:02 AM] asianwaifu#3569
oop-


[03/03/2020 6:02 AM] Christorm747#7693

[03/03/2020 6:07 AM] Christorm747#7693
See you actually got sick, and me it's 50/50. No one likes getting yelled at and I don't know about you but  i don't like crying.  The assignment wasn't that important i just have a little OCD about it


[03/03/2020 6:08 AM] asianwaifu#3569
depends on your view of bad i guess


[03/03/2020 6:08 AM] asianwaifu#3569
today was a better day then most


[03/03/2020 6:09 AM] Christorm747#7693
I suppose. Well that's one way of looking at it.


[03/03/2020 6:10 AM] Christorm747#7693

[03/03/2020 6:10 AM] asianwaifu#3569

[03/03/2020 6:11 AM] asianwaifu#3569
lol yeah


[03/03/2020 6:12 AM] asianwaifu#3569

[03/03/2020 6:12 AM] asianwaifu#3569
but agreed


[03/03/2020 6:15 AM] Christorm747#7693
Come on you got to have a little more hope than that. I'm just 16 going to be 17 soon and my mom wants me to get a job. But I think well at least I'll be paid. You got to focus on the positive.


[03/03/2020 6:15 AM] asianwaifu#3569
yeah my positive is 18


[03/03/2020 6:16 AM] asianwaifu#3569
just a few more months


[03/03/2020 6:16 AM] asianwaifu#3569
my mom isnt the friendliest.. to put it nicely


[03/03/2020 6:16 AM] asianwaifu#3569

[03/03/2020 6:17 AM] asianwaifu#3569
shes friendly


[03/03/2020 6:17 AM] asianwaifu#3569
with her hands


[03/03/2020 6:18 AM] Christorm747#7693
Haha same with mine. Let's just say she's a yeller. And the words take a toll after multiple times.
Oh and may I ask when you're birthday is


[03/03/2020 6:19 AM] asianwaifu#3569
yeah my mom is more physical i guess you could say


[03/03/2020 6:19 AM] asianwaifu#3569

[03/03/2020 6:20 AM] Christorm747#7693
Ah sorry about that. I can relate. But I don't really want to get into detail in the general server. 
Ahh yeah that's more then a few months away.  Mine is April 15


[03/03/2020 6:21 AM] asianwaifu#3569
omg thats my boyfriends bday


[03/03/2020 6:21 AM] asianwaifu#3569
he will be 20


[03/03/2020 6:21 AM] Christorm747#7693
Cool!


[03/03/2020 6:22 AM] asianwaifu#3569
and mine isnt too far. 2 months and 27 days till draduation and then 2 months and 21 days after that till i turn 18


[03/03/2020 6:22 AM] asianwaifu#3569
*graduation


[03/03/2020 6:26 AM] Christorm747#7693
Wow you really can't wait for graduation. Seems like you have a timer time ticking until each day arrives


[03/03/2020 6:26 AM] asianwaifu#3569
yeah


[03/03/2020 6:26 AM] asianwaifu#3569
i have check points


[03/03/2020 6:27 AM] asianwaifu#3569
my mom also doesnt accept my relationship until im 18 so i havent seen my bf in over a year


[03/03/2020 6:28 AM] asianwaifu#3569
im 17 hes 19


[03/03/2020 6:29 AM] Christorm747#7693
Ooh that sucks. My mom has super strict standards for dating with me. But 2 years older isn't that bad of an age difference. But that's probably not the only reason why she doesn't like the relationship. Right?


[03/03/2020 6:29 AM] asianwaifu#3569
no thats the only reason


[03/03/2020 6:30 AM] asianwaifu#3569
she likes him as a person


[03/03/2020 6:30 AM] asianwaifu#3569
but i cant see him till im 18


[03/03/2020 6:31 AM] Christorm747#7693
Really? Oh that's good. Oh do you say least text him, stay in touch?


[03/03/2020 6:31 AM] asianwaifu#3569
i text him but im not really allowed to do that either


[03/03/2020 6:32 AM] asianwaifu#3569
she will get mad if she catches me talking to him lol


[03/03/2020 6:33 AM] Christorm747#7693
Oh I get that too. I don't think there's anyone who hasn't texted someone they're not allowed too. Lol üòâ


[03/03/2020 6:33 AM] asianwaifu#3569

[03/22/2020 12:56 AM] lil_cat_beans

So how do I play cards agains humanaty?


[03/22/2020 12:57 AM] noobinator8150
Well, there‚Äôs a black card, it says something and has a blank


[03/22/2020 12:57 AM] noobinator8150
You use one of the white cards in your hand to fill in the blank


[03/22/2020 12:57 AM] lil_cat_beans
Iz a funni game


[03/22/2020 12:58 AM] gimp6615
Ok so if I have a black card I need a white card?


[03/22/2020 12:58 AM] lil_cat_beans
No everyone has the same black card


[03/22/2020 12:58 AM] lil_cat_beans
But different white cards


[03/22/2020 12:58 AM] gimp6615
Seems raceist but I will go with it


[03/22/2020 12:58 AM] gimp6615
How do I play it tho?


[03/22/2020 12:58 AM] noobinator8150
And the person for the round who is called the Cezar will judge who played the card that was the best


[03/22/2020 12:59 AM] noobinator8150
Specifically they pick which card wins and the person who played it gets a point


[03/22/2020 12:59 AM] noobinator8150
First to whatever the point goal is wins


[03/22/2020 12:59 AM] gimp6615
Ok so we have to play black and white cards and the Cezar of the round chose who wins?


[03/22/2020 12:59 AM] noobinator8150
The black card is the same one for everyone you don‚Äôt play one yourself


[03/22/2020 1:00 AM] gimp6615
Ok so you have the same black cards as everyone but diffrent white cards


[03/22/2020 1:00 AM] noobinator8150
It normally comes off the top of the deck


[03/22/2020 1:00 AM] gimp6615
Ok so how does the site look like?


[03/22/2020 1:00 AM] noobinator8150
It‚Äôs just the same thing


[03/22/2020 1:01 AM] noobinator8150
Without it being physical cards


[03/22/2020 1:01 AM] noobinator8150
And some things are different for convenience


[03/22/2020 1:01 AM] noobinator8150
But it‚Äôs all the same mechanics wise


[03/22/2020 1:01 AM] gimp6615
Ok whats the site's name so I can look it up?


[03/22/2020 1:01 AM] noobinator8150

@Qiqi Impact what's ur real name I'm curious


[03/23/2020 2:25 AM] VVRetr0VV#3755
like, it says i can skip wait time if i have one person in my group. so how do i do that?


[03/23/2020 2:25 AM] qiqi_impact
if you have one person in your group and then a "donate" button


[03/23/2020 2:25 AM] gimp6615
No it says if you have a person in your group that donated


[03/23/2020 2:25 AM] qiqi_impact
does it not show up for you?


[03/23/2020 2:25 AM] qiqi_impact
I'll clean up the wording to make that clear.


[03/23/2020 2:26 AM] VVRetr0VV#3755
i see the donate button, but not a group buttin or anything


[03/23/2020 2:26 AM] qiqi_impact
"donate" is part of the sentence


[03/23/2020 2:26 AM] VVRetr0VV#3755
i have to do both? not like one or the other?


[03/23/2020 2:26 AM] qiqi_impact
"Join an open game, or have any 1 player in your group donate to skip the waitlist forever."


[03/23/2020 2:27 AM] VVRetr0VV#3755

If kinetic energy can be turned into thermal energy then how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?

c ya b


[03/30/2020 2:14 PM] Muchabi#0264
So the average boxer punches at about 500 joules. To cook a chick you will need around 230,000 joules of energy. Assuming the average human can only punch at around 150 joules, we find that by dividing the amount of energy to cook a chicken with a punch by the punch of the average human we will get 1,533. This means it will take most people around 1500 punches to cook a chicken.

[03/30/2020 2:15 PM] Muchabi#0264
So it's not a matter of how strong you punch but how many times you can puch before you break your fist.

[03/30/2020 2:16 PM] Chevi#9604
alright bet


[03/30/2020 2:23 PM] Muchabi#0264
@Chevi To do that you will need to run about 30miles per second or about 48000 meters/second on a 100m track.


[03/30/2020 2:24 PM] Chevi#9604
Alright easy

[03/30/2020 2:31 PM] henrytheverybreast#9559
The chicken would just fall apart tho? and it's the energy it takes to punch the chicken, there isn't any joules being exerted onto the chicken


[03/30/2020 2:37 PM] Muchabi#0264
Well true. But in this situation we are assuming that the punch can cook the chicken.

I agree with that statement


[04/02/2020 3:52 AM] GalaxyWolf#8610
Bops?


[04/02/2020 3:53 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
What is a bops?


[04/02/2020 3:53 AM] GalaxyWolf#8610
I have no idea


[04/02/2020 3:56 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
Like the 2006 Bop it game?

[04/02/2020 3:57 AM] lil_cat_beans
Bops are good songs


[04/02/2020 3:58 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
So a bops is a type of song?


[04/02/2020 3:58 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
Like a genre?


[04/02/2020 3:58 AM] lil_cat_beans
No


[04/02/2020 3:58 AM] GalaxyWolf#8610

[04/02/2020 3:58 AM] GalaxyWolf#8610
It‚Äôs good songs


[04/02/2020 3:59 AM] lil_cat_beans
Ye


[04/02/2020 4:00 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
I don‚Äôt understand? So if I were to listen to ‚Äúa Bops‚Äù it would refer to ‚Äúa good song.‚Äù But instead of saying ‚Äúa good song‚Äù it would be ‚Äúa bops‚Äù


[04/02/2020 4:00 AM] .grumblebee
listen to a "bop" is a good song because you "bop" your head to it.


[04/02/2020 4:00 AM] lil_cat_beans
What you would call a bop is what you think a good song is


[04/02/2020 4:00 AM] lil_cat_beans

So if I were to listen to a classic I would confided it to be a bop?


[04/02/2020 4:02 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
Consider


[04/02/2020 4:02 AM] Homiesexual#5306
Maybe back in that time period


[04/02/2020 4:02 AM] lil_cat_beans
Like what song do you like @Sgt. Manslaughter


[04/02/2020 4:02 AM] GalaxyWolf#8610
What‚Äôs a song you like ? Whatever that song is it‚Äôs a bop because you like it


[04/02/2020 4:02 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
Guns N Roses


[04/02/2020 4:03 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366

[04/02/2020 4:03 AM] lil_cat_beans
Then that would be a bop to you


[04/02/2020 4:03 AM] Sgt. Manslaughter#7366
Ah okay


[04/02/2020 4:03 AM] lil_cat_beans
Their songs


[04/02/2020 4:03 AM] lil_cat_beans
Would be bops to you


[04/02/2020 4:03 AM] lil_cat_beans

don't kill yourself. It's fucking selfish and you're a sad piece of shit if you do it. You hurt the people who care about you the most and people you haven't thought about in forever. I had a friend commit suicide and it sucks. It amazes me how many people were affected by his death, including me because I hadn't talked to him in years but I still cared. I promise you. 1-800-273-8255. call them. @Crystal1999

Cards that were added: 

White:

Hot, skinless sex in a Brazen Bull.
Elder abuse.
Grabbing Donald Trump by his saggy neck pussy.
Peeling back a hangnail, and inadvertently ripping all the flesh from your arm.
Skullfucking a monkey.
Guzzling bloody urine from a bedpan.


Black:

In a foreboding press briefing, the DHS warned that _______ is a distant but looming threat.

‚Äú_______ is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be.  . . Unnatural.‚Äù

I do like _______, but only if it‚Äôs warm.

Your chances of being killed by ______ are low, but never zero.

My aunt got drunk at my wedding, and whipped out _______ for all to see. . .  I‚Äôm so done. . .

I‚Äôve added more cards to the Masters of Evil deck:

White:
A bulldog sphincter that looks like Donald Trump.
Some German kid who is better than you in every way.
Rubbing a can of Monster to summon Joe Exotic.
Cat turds rolled in Cheeto dust.
Auschwoods, the Jewish Summer Camp.
Eating all the crayons.
Staring at a solar eclipse.
Wiping your hairy ass with used fly tape.
Being more fucked than a gay chicken at a Chick-fil-A.

Black:
This whole ‚ÄúSocial Distancing‚Äù thing helped me find my new obsession: _______.

If I like _______, does that make me a furry?

How does Donald Trump unwind?

Apologies if this is a dumb question but how exactly do you log in using the same user you've had before (and set a password/recovery email for)? I set all that up but whenever I try to log in under Taylor7500 I just get told that the username is taken.


[05/22/2020 8:24 PM] James Ramirez#5823
Thot probably means someone is using the acc 
Or 
Your logged in on another device


[05/22/2020 8:25 PM] bruhaps#6310
Always password protect your main account


[05/22/2020 8:26 PM] pickleas_cage
I don't think either are the case. It was perfectly free a couple hours ago (and I'm yet to meet anyoen else who uses Taylor7500) and I set a very strong password.


[05/22/2020 8:26 PM] pickleas_cage
I've not used any device except my current desktop


[05/22/2020 8:27 PM] Badge#4935
Wait did you shove a recovery email on?


[05/22/2020 8:27 PM] pickleas_cage
Pretty sure


[05/22/2020 8:28 PM] pickleas_cage
Not seeing a "forgot password" or similar option though


[05/22/2020 8:31 PM] Badge#4935
Then their should be an option to type in your recovery email at the bottom below where it says your name was taken


[05/22/2020 8:31 PM] Badge#4935
There*


[05/22/2020 8:31 PM] pickleas_cage
I just get the discord/youtube/how to play icons.


[05/22/2020 8:32 PM] pickleas_cage
I guess it's possible it didn't confirm or something like that. I just don't really get how the username is somehow locked down. I use a password manager so I'm literally copy-pasting it exactly but it doesn't seem to want to behave. Oh well, guess I'll put in a ticket


[05/22/2020 8:33 PM] Badge#4935

[05/22/2020 8:34 PM] pickleas_cage
Still not used to gmail trying to automatically categorise everything but it appears that I did not. Guess I'm not used to confirmation checkboxes to the side of the field rather than below it


[05/22/2020 8:38 PM] Badge#4935
At the top on search type on Azala on Gmail


[05/22/2020 8:38 PM] Badge#4935
The email should pop up


[05/22/2020 8:38 PM] pickleas_cage
Yeah I got nothing


[05/22/2020 8:38 PM] pickleas_cage
Seems that I screwed up on the email at least but the p/w thing still bugs me. Oh well, nothing to be done I suppose.

I know how you feel, I'll keep an eye out for anyone using your account in the future

@Qiqi Impact Oh dang, are they under a different name or are the official cards just not on the site anymore?


[06/02/2020 5:38 AM] qiqi_impact
gone. and if you recreate it, I'm removing that too


[06/02/2020 5:38 AM] qiqi_impact
you can probably figure out why


[06/02/2020 7:30 PM] Reds Ghost#2361
Will there ever be a feature like /il to look at the list of people you ignored?


[06/02/2020 8:16 PM] qiqi_impact
probably not. it's of limited utility, and unlike friends lists, ignore lists do not have a fixed size


[06/02/2020 8:17 PM] qiqi_impact
tell me why you'd need it (I might have overlooked a useful case)


[06/02/2020 9:35 PM] Reds Ghost#2361
I don't really need it i was just wondering if it might be a possibility in the future for people who ignore a lot of people and forget who all theey ignored


[06/02/2020 9:56 PM] Badge#4935
Wait is there a list of those you ignored? Is there an option to see that list?

Hi, just joined. Is there a way i can make a custom deck?


[06/11/2020 9:19 PM] timewizard27
There's a setting on the side bar that says make decks


[06/11/2020 9:20 PM] timewizard27
unless your on mobile then idk


[06/11/2020 9:20 PM] bruhaps#6310
What device are you using


[06/11/2020 9:21 PM] bruhaps#6310
Im on mobile and i make my decks on the desktop site

Make*


[06/11/2020 9:23 PM] timewizard27
Should be under the place where it says "mobile view"


[06/11/2020 9:24 PM] cryptted
Under mobile view it just says browse decks


[06/11/2020 9:24 PM] timewizard27
hmm, maybe you have to play for a little bit before you can then


[06/11/2020 9:25 PM] cryptted

Hello, I want to thank you, devs, for great site. It is really clear and responsive, a mile over the original" pretend_you_are_xyz". You created it from scratch or is it just tweaked scheme you used?


[06/12/2020 11:23 PM] qiqi_impact
@CryptTed you didn't pick a player name. without one, there is no way to "own" a deck.


[06/12/2020 11:24 PM] qiqi_impact
@Puszcza built from scratch

[06/13/2020 5:35 AM] timewizard27
I'd rather stay single then force my way into a relationship that could be toxic and ruin me like the last one


[06/13/2020 5:36 AM] ezixi
Most of my relationships are toxic


[06/13/2020 5:36 AM] Homiesexual#5306
Yea I have to work on some personal issues before I can open up to someone else


[06/13/2020 5:36 AM] timewizard27
That's what i've been doing, It's better to improve yourself and make yourself the best you can for that perfect person instead of trying to find them


[06/13/2020 5:37 AM] ezixi
Like I was just in a relationship we broke up the beginning of this week but like we're working it out ig


[06/13/2020 5:37 AM] timewizard27
yeah


[06/13/2020 5:37 AM] Homiesexual#5306
Ahh yes a perfectly healthy relationship


[06/13/2020 5:38 AM] timewizard27
My ex was a bitch to me when she dumped me then about two months later she sent me a message saying she made a mistake by dumping me and missed me


[06/13/2020 5:38 AM] timewizard27
I rejected her ass


[06/13/2020 5:39 AM] Homiesexual#5306
Yea that sounds like the bitch that‚Äôs in a terrible relationship and throws a baby on the mix to fix it


[06/13/2020 5:39 AM] timewizard27
Yeah, really


[06/13/2020 5:39 AM] timewizard27
I never fucked her


[06/13/2020 5:39 AM] Homiesexual#5306
But nope they just argue at night to not trauma the child


[06/13/2020 5:39 AM] Homiesexual#5306
But the child is hearing it all any way


[06/13/2020 5:39 AM] timewizard27
Yeah


[06/13/2020 5:40 AM] ezixi
One of my ex's were really toxic he kept body shaming me and cursing me out calling me names and shit and use to force me to do things that I didn't want to do


[06/13/2020 5:40 AM] timewizard27
He sounds awful


[06/13/2020 5:41 AM] ezixi
Yeah broke up with him on new years


[06/13/2020 5:41 AM] timewizard27
Nice


[06/13/2020 5:41 AM] ezixi
And now I hope he dies in a hole alone


[06/13/2020 5:41 AM] ezixi
After we broke up he started dating my best friend


[06/13/2020 5:42 AM] Homiesexual#5306
That‚Äôs always nice


[06/13/2020 5:42 AM] timewizard27
If my ex didn't dump me I would have stayed in the relationship because I was too into the feeling of lust to realize how toxic it was.


[06/13/2020 5:42 AM] timewizard27
What a *insert bad word here*


[06/13/2020 5:42 AM] Homiesexual#5306

You‚Äôre asking to be banned


[07/08/2020 9:51 PM] Deleted User
Rules are generally relaxed. It's usually pretty obvious when you deserve a ban.

**Banned:**
- **Self-promotion (a link to your personal YouTube video or other social media)*
- Attention-seeking spam
- Begging for a waitlist skip
- Links to other CAH sites

**But these are OK:**
- Posting a link to the game you're in

@Deleted User it's a reasonable question and I updated the rules. If you are currently playing CAH, you can add your discord to the CAH game link.

But for general game night promotion, the kind you could spam every server in your list with - no.


[07/08/2020 10:54 PM] qiqi_impact
you may also want to check your entitlement about response times. you come off as a piece of work and I almost didn't bother responding


[07/09/2020 12:29 AM] Deleted User
@Qiqi Impact Thank you for the response I appreciate it.

To be completely honest with you, my problem wasn‚Äôt as big as it was I was more annoyed with how who I‚Äôm assuming to be staff (@~Rose~) responded to me when I asked a genuine question.

I seen their dickish behaviour and seized the opportunity and tried my hardest to piss them off. Maybes I should not have done that, fair enough, but also your staff should know as a server representative to not be toxic towards members.

No hard feelings, there was no personal intent behind anything so as I say thanks for the response.

Hello. I've been trying to figure out if there is a way to get a CSV decklist into an Azala deck. I noticed in the FAQ it says to use Google Sheets, which make me wonder if there is a way to have a deck sourced from Sheets?


[08/30/2020 9:10 PM] unwary
Or was the intention that you copy things manually from the Sheet, and use to hash out ideas/phrasing


[08/31/2020 12:32 AM] qiqi_impact
@Unwary that's just for a local copy. there's no public import tool. if you have an existing CSV, send it over and I can probably figure out how to parse it


[08/31/2020 12:34 AM] unwary

What does a Christmas tree and a priest have in common?
Their balls are just for decoration
What do monkeys and black people have in common?
They both hang from trees
What is Osama bin Laden's favorite football team?
The new York Jets
What's the difference between 9/11 jumpers and the planes?
The planes never landed.

Is it gay for a straight male to date a trans male


[10/07/2020 3:39 AM] Pussy#5928
Like, I'll call you who you are, just I wont call you by your pronouns, it's too much for me to really put time into.

No, it's just, if they have a dick, they have a dick, no matter what it's gay, end of discussion there.


[10/07/2020 3:41 AM] john_f_kenndy
but what if they are female and have a dick tho


[10/07/2020 3:41 AM] DeepFried#5947
One of my friends started simping for a female, so we started making fun of him


[10/07/2020 3:41 AM] Pussy#5928
That's if they transition from male to female


[10/07/2020 3:41 AM] john_f_kenndy
is it gay or straight since they are female but have a dick


[10/07/2020 3:42 AM] DeepFried#5947

[10/07/2020 3:42 AM] Pussy#5928
But either way i'd say it's gay since they were originally male.


[10/07/2020 3:42 AM] Pussy#5928
Then again, kinda.


[10/07/2020 3:43 AM] john_f_kenndy
but a person having a dick and pussy is a real thing so is fucking them gay or straight

If I find out they're trans, I'd rather leave them. Yeah, that's me.


[10/07/2020 3:45 AM] Pussy#5928
I don't hate trans, or binary, or anything like that, I just can't deal with anything outside of boy or girl, since I'm used to boy or girl.

We tell people cause we feel more comfortable as that gender and would be more comforable if people used ohr preffered pronouns

being gay has nothing to do with gender


[10/19/2020 9:33 PM] RawChicken#6917
Preference is unrelated

Again


[10/19/2020 9:33 PM] hippy.gurl#5731
Um its part of LGBT and we protect and sopport eachother so yes it does


[10/19/2020 9:33 PM] luvfrmnaylah#3147
Genders a social construct


[10/19/2020 9:34 PM] luvfrmnaylah#3147

soul theory concerning sexuality:
its like so gayness isnt just like well gayness
it was at the beginning the straight was guys liking guys and girls liking girls and the two only having sex to carry on with the race and to form and hold bonds between two clans
but then the actual thing comes in where souls over time get reused and put into fresh bodies
and those souls arent the same gender
guys who like other guys is what is meant to happen but guys who like girls is just a girls soul in a guys body
and a big event happened which caused all the souls to be mixed up and well a big amount of souls were lost and the bodies just turned to ash
those that didnt go away were mostly male bodies but new bodies got souls in them that werent the same gender
and a lot of females souls got tore but their souls were strong and didnt fall into the void and the males souls were a little weaker but the bodies were a lot stronger
so the females fled into the male bodies for fear of getting lost to the void of nothingness
so the gay of old times or the bond former or the kid maker whatever is now the straightness we know today
and bisexuality and pansexuality is just many souls in the same body
and asexuality is just like people who either have too many souls and didnt turn into pansexual and just like stayed in confusion or its just people hating everyone and well asexuality probably has been around for a long time
and thats soul theory for sexualities
hope you like it and now can see why i can call straight people gay

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust

Im always taking new suggestions for animes


[12/01/2020 6:23 AM] sharpencil
It's a live action show about a retired detective who goes searching for a missing girl with the help of an imaginary friend, who's a sky blue unicorn hippo named Happy. It's got action, funny/wtf scenes &... BLOOD!


[12/01/2020 6:24 AM] sharpencil
If u're looking for a good anime, perhaps Castlevania... if that's considered an anime


[12/01/2020 6:24 AM] weebychild
Mm.
It sounds interesting but at the same time confuses me. I might have to look into it a bit more.


[12/01/2020 6:25 AM] sharpencil
Just watching the 1st episode would probs give u the feel of the show, but it keeps getting weirder & weirder as it goes on


[12/01/2020 6:26 AM] sharpencil
Happy! that is


[12/01/2020 6:26 AM] weebychild
Ok. When you say weird do you mean "what the- " or food wars.

.....It's a weird show


[12/01/2020 6:30 AM] weebychild
If that's the case im sorry but thats a no for me.


[12/01/2020 6:33 AM] sharpencil
Just... plz watch the 1st episode. If u don't like wat u see, then that's fine, but if u do,... then u're in for 1 heck of a ride

Wanna use a good deck just with pictures? I made one. It includes all kinds of popular and funny stuff.

@CaptainPollutionTV you probably need https - all the images are blanking out for me with a warning in Chrome:

```

```


[12/20/2020 12:46 PM] qiqi_impact
probably don't need to change the card text, just make sure your server can handle the https version and direct it to the right picture


[12/20/2020 12:46 PM] captainpollutiontv
ah i see, imma install a ssl cert


[12/20/2020 12:47 PM] captainpollutiontv
firefox didnt show this


[12/20/2020 12:47 PM] qiqi_impact
correct


[12/20/2020 12:47 PM] captainpollutiontv
i just got the domain for this deck üòÅ


[12/20/2020 12:48 PM] qiqi_impact

[12/20/2020 12:48 PM] qiqi_impact
you can set it up through cloudflare, it can do SSL and also cache your requests so your server doesn't get hit for every image request


[12/20/2020 12:48 PM] qiqi_impact
all totally free


[12/20/2020 12:49 PM] captainpollutiontv
oh thats a good tipp. i never used cloudflare before


[12/20/2020 12:50 PM] captainpollutiontv
what do ya think about the deck itself tho


[12/20/2020 12:51 PM] qiqi_impact
it's fine. I don't play a lot of images, it seems good though


[12/20/2020 12:51 PM] qiqi_impact
I can probably give better feedback on text cards - I know how good white/black cards work

it doesnt contain hardcore stuff. pretty normal popculture


[12/20/2020 12:52 PM] qiqi_impact
right


[12/20/2020 12:53 PM] captainpollutiontv
im gonna write a german question deck which works good with pictures.


[12/20/2020 12:54 PM] H o o m a n#5938
anyone wants to play?


[12/20/2020 12:54 PM] qiqi_impact
@H o o m a n not atm but thanks


[12/20/2020 12:54 PM] captainpollutiontv
my other german deck works pretty well so far. i caused a lot of laughter in some streams


[12/20/2020 12:54 PM] qiqi_impact
I don't see a lot of germans using the "I'm streaming" thing


[12/20/2020 12:54 PM] qiqi_impact
is there some sort of lewd content law in Germany?


[12/20/2020 12:55 PM] H o o m a n#5938
k


[12/20/2020 12:55 PM] qiqi_impact
I mean, as a proportion of total users broadcasting, I see less from Germans


[12/20/2020 12:55 PM] qiqi_impact
might just be low sample size overall


[12/20/2020 12:56 PM] captainpollutiontv
nah, not for the game. i think twitch can delete or ban users when they use really fucked up decks


[12/20/2020 12:57 PM] captainpollutiontv
im trying to raise the awareness for this game lately and promote my deck. you may dont know it but there are a lot of trashy german decks.


[12/20/2020 12:59 PM] captainpollutiontv
many dont care about good writing or grammar for example. therefore some people get bored and quit


[12/20/2020 1:01 PM] qiqi_impact
are the default ones good?


[12/20/2020 1:01 PM] qiqi_impact
like when you join a game with a new player


[12/20/2020 1:01 PM] captainpollutiontv
the standard german deck is not big tho. kinda repititive


[12/20/2020 1:01 PM] qiqi_impact
ok


[12/20/2020 1:02 PM] qiqi_impact
that is a problem with all decks


[12/20/2020 1:02 PM] qiqi_impact
not just in german


[12/20/2020 1:02 PM] qiqi_impact
I mean, the trash quality


[12/20/2020 1:02 PM] captainpollutiontv
well. my deck has over 2000 cards. works well for me and my fellas


[12/20/2020 1:04 PM] qiqi_impact
let me translate the first few cards of your deck, 1 sec


[12/20/2020 1:04 PM] qiqi_impact
not bad!


[12/20/2020 1:05 PM] captainpollutiontv
sure, some are normal like names of celebs and some are filled with dark humor


[12/20/2020 1:05 PM] qiqi_impact
do you regularly browse german decks and find good ones?


[12/20/2020 1:06 PM] qiqi_impact
I can do it for English, but obviously I can't pick the "best" for german


[12/20/2020 1:07 PM] captainpollutiontv
nah, i just work on my deck. make it bigger with quality cards and sometimes take ideas from other decks. in my games i use just my deck. its big enough. plus the grammar and quality of some german decks fucks the game up


[12/20/2020 1:08 PM] captainpollutiontv
i see other german decks when i watch streamers on twitch. thats why i know about the poor quality


[12/20/2020 1:09 PM] qiqi_impact
a lot of people cannot evaluate the quality of a deck in general. they will often search a term and add every deck with that term in the title


[12/20/2020 1:10 PM] qiqi_impact
without looking at the cards


[12/20/2020 1:10 PM] captainpollutiontv
yes i know. maybe im kinda more into quality cuz i write novels in my free time too


[12/20/2020 1:10 PM] qiqi_impact
yep


[12/20/2020 1:12 PM] captainpollutiontv
i dont think there is a best deck. its a matter of taste. i would pick a non repititive one with correct grammar and variety of content


[12/20/2020 1:13 PM] qiqi_impact
so would I


[12/20/2020 1:13 PM] qiqi_impact
this is why I heavily curated the top English decks in the early years


[12/20/2020 1:14 PM] captainpollutiontv
may i do an offer?


[12/20/2020 1:14 PM] qiqi_impact
you want your deck in the defaults?


[12/20/2020 1:15 PM] captainpollutiontv
hmm, i could check the standard german deck. add its best stuff to mine. then you have a big good default deck


[12/20/2020 1:16 PM] qiqi_impact
the problem is this - anything in the defaults has to "feel" like the original deck


[12/20/2020 1:17 PM] captainpollutiontv
im well aware of that. i wrote my deck in that way


[12/20/2020 1:17 PM] captainpollutiontv
i have to add some of the original cards tho


[12/20/2020 1:20 PM] qiqi_impact
just from translation - I can already tell it has a very different feel from original CAH. it's definitely more offensive. I'd have to have the "medium" and "high" buttons (like with English) and set yours to the high


[12/20/2020 1:20 PM] captainpollutiontv
that is very true ^^


[12/20/2020 1:21 PM] captainpollutiontv
well, many cards are. some are pretty normal. the combination makes it for me XD

Hi, I want to create a non offensive deck to play with my family. But I don't understand how to do it. When creating cards it says answer, question 1, question 2, question 3. Can someone explain? Or send me a video? Thanks

[12/30/2020 5:31 PM] qiqi_impact
@Jaffeth The placeholder text in the gray box tells you exactly how to do it:
`Add a card - type here, click one of A (answer), Q1, Q2, or Q3 (question, # of blanks), then click the checkmark.`


[12/30/2020 5:42 PM] .jaffeth
I still don't understand, isn't there a video?


[12/30/2020 5:44 PM] qiqi_impact
hold on. do you have a second for a call?


[12/30/2020 5:44 PM] qiqi_impact
I will explain this in detail


[12/30/2020 5:49 PM] qiqi_impact
@Jaffeth I don't think anyone's made a video. It's unclear to me where you got stuck.


[12/30/2020 5:57 PM] qiqi_impact
welp, you disappeared. I'm heading out for the day.


[12/30/2020 7:03 PM] .jaffeth
Sorry I was afk


[12/30/2020 7:05 PM] .jaffeth
My question is what does q1, q2, and means in this game?


[12/30/2020 7:05 PM] qiqi_impact
sure


[12/30/2020 7:05 PM] qiqi_impact
do you have a sec to get in a voice call?


[12/30/2020 7:06 PM] .jaffeth
I cant upload screenshot here


[12/30/2020 7:06 PM] qiqi_impact
right


[12/30/2020 7:06 PM] qiqi_impact
clearly there's a problem I can't underrstand via text


[12/30/2020 7:06 PM] .jaffeth
Well I'm at the beach


[12/30/2020 7:06 PM] .jaffeth
Can I send you a screenshot?


[12/30/2020 7:07 PM] qiqi_impact
it's not so much a screenshot as much as - if you understand how black cards work in Cards Against Humanity, you know they have either 1, 2, or 3 blanks.


[12/30/2020 7:07 PM] qiqi_impact
those are the Q1 Q2 and Q3


[12/30/2020 7:08 PM] qiqi_impact
you use that to specify what type of black card it is


[12/30/2020 7:08 PM] qiqi_impact
or if it's a white card, click A


[12/30/2020 7:09 PM] qiqi_impact
so you have three questions in that screenshot


[12/30/2020 7:09 PM] qiqi_impact
one with 1 blank, one with 2 blanks, and one with 3 blanks


[12/30/2020 7:10 PM] .jaffeth
Oh like q1: he said__
Q2: she had a____ and I said__
Q3: I  want to go to____ and ____ with___


[12/30/2020 7:10 PM] .jaffeth
Like that?


[12/30/2020 7:10 PM] qiqi_impact
you can type anything you want in the card text, and then specify Q1, Q2 or Q3 based on the number of blanks

[01/16/2021 9:29 AM] tonkee2
Ok


[01/16/2021 9:30 AM] captainpollutiontv
So, i made a picture deck with 1600 cards. I also made a deck with 400 question cards especially usable for picture answers. The questions are in german. Do you think it would be a good idea to translate them to english? Making it usable for more people.


[01/16/2021 9:30 AM] tonkee2
Um I don‚Äôt understand


[01/16/2021 9:30 AM] MinusGuide42#6047
Yes it would


[01/16/2021 9:31 AM] captainpollutiontv
We played with these decks and it was freakin funny. Everbody understands pictures but you need good questions for them to work. And i think there are little more people who talk english than german. Just a little more XD

[02/06/2021 11:14 PM] weebychild
What do you do in this game?


[02/06/2021 11:14 PM] inari_13
Is it a free online game?


[02/06/2021 11:15 PM] dripp2655
Each party pack has different games and when you choose 1 game, it should be a room code that you join and play using phones and laptops


[02/06/2021 11:16 PM] inari_13

I had an idea on how to make the story of Orpheus & Euridice even more tragic while I was in the shower, if anyone's interested in hearing it


[02/15/2021 5:02 AM] areaperinred
How do you make it more tragic


[02/15/2021 5:07 AM] sharpencil
Well, for one,.... in my version, Orpheus was born blind. Same things happen. He & Eurydice fall in love. Eurydice dies. Orpheus goes to hadestown to get her back & impresses Hades. Here's where some of the differences come in play. The deals still that he has to go to the light without looking at Eurydice, but to make the stakes higher, the gods make it so Orpheus could finally see. If he makes it out without looking at Eurydice, she's free & Orpheus gets to keep his vision.


Just before he goes to the light, his doubt kicks in & he turns around, seeing Eurydice for the first & final time. Eurydice is also the last thing he'd ever see, since once Eurydice disappears, so does his vision & he goes blind once more.


[02/15/2021 5:08 AM] areaperinred
That‚Äôs actually sounds a lot better than the original

new P5 strikers game is a waste, im not bothering with it


[02/18/2021 11:38 PM] inari_13
At least give it a try before judging


[02/18/2021 11:39 PM] Savato#1488
I saw the full review/preview, combat was completely changed, its more of a fighting game rather than story-driven. They removed confidants and romance paths. the entire game is combat driven


[02/18/2021 11:39 PM] Savato#1488
i might try it when it comes down in price and i see more reviews but rn im NOT digging it.


[02/18/2021 11:45 PM] vaporjester
It's literally just Persona Warriors


[02/18/2021 11:46 PM] vaporjester
It's the spin-off


[02/18/2021 11:46 PM] vaporjester
That's the entire point


[02/18/2021 11:46 PM] inari_13
Yeah I guess


[02/18/2021 11:47 PM] Savato#1488
^^ typical to atlus fashion, if they made a P5 spin off that was all story and less combat id be all over it


[02/18/2021 11:47 PM] inari_13
I can't believe they got rid of romance


[02/18/2021 11:47 PM] vaporjester
I feel like no one has been paying attention to the past


[02/18/2021 11:48 PM] inari_13
I hope the 25th anniversary makes up for striker


[02/18/2021 11:49 PM] inari_13
What you guys think gonna happen


[02/18/2021 11:56 PM] Savato#1488
atlus will milk strikers and move on to another spin off


[02/19/2021 12:00 AM] vaporjester
After Strikers, they'll move on to the next Persona game


[02/19/2021 12:01 AM] vaporjester
This will be the third spin-off featuring P5


[02/19/2021 12:02 AM] inari_13
I wonder what color they'll do next. I was thinking a cool green color


[02/19/2021 12:05 AM] vaporjester
Yeah, green would be cool


[02/19/2021 12:09 AM] weebychild
I thought you wouldn't touch it with a 20 foot poll. Even if the price was lowered


[02/19/2021 12:10 AM] Savato#1488
i would do it begrudgingly


[02/19/2021 12:11 AM] weebychild
But you still wouldn't touch it with a 20 foot poll.


[02/19/2021 12:24 AM] inari_13

[02/20/2021 5:27 AM] _bebsi_
i tried "reset deck" but that didn't do anything


[02/20/2021 6:45 AM] qiqi_impact
@Bebsi Main Menu > Make Decks. Select the one you want to kill and click "delete" under the "rename" and above "search in deck"


[02/20/2021 6:46 AM] _bebsi_
okay is there anyway to delete the pre-installed decks?


[02/20/2021 6:47 AM] _bebsi_
i want to host a game for a group of kids at my church


[02/20/2021 6:48 AM] _bebsi_
and some of these aren't exactly appropriate
ik i can disable them but i'd rather it not be on screen should i choose to share it

Low key though if you're trying to get church kids to play this game you might want to find a different game. This isn't a church friendly game in general


[02/20/2021 6:49 AM] inari_13
Yeah


[02/20/2021 6:49 AM] _bebsi_
ye ik i'm just looking around and i've played this game before


[02/20/2021 6:49 AM] inari_13
This is the kind of game that would make tons of Jesus jokes


[02/20/2021 6:49 AM] _bebsi_
i figured i'd make my own deck to use for the game


[02/20/2021 6:49 AM] inari_13

I looked it up


[02/22/2021 11:08 PM] weebychild
Its a game made by atlus long before persona and its a game where you play as a doctor and save the world from G.U.L.I.T (Gangliated Utrophin Immuno Latency Toxin) and its a really fun game and i adore the series so much


[02/22/2021 11:09 PM] inari_13
No wonder it sort of reminds me of Persona


[02/22/2021 11:09 PM] weebychild
Its actually where me and savatos user names come from


[02/22/2021 11:09 PM] inari_13
I looked at the game and the character a little bit similar to the Persona series


[02/22/2021 11:09 PM] weebychild
See. 
Kyriaki is the first strand of guilt you run into Savato is the last one


[02/22/2021 11:10 PM] inari_13
That explains Savato's username


[02/22/2021 11:11 PM] weebychild
Kyriaki can affect the lungs stomach and one other organ I think the liver. And it cuts it up little by little until you get to the queen part of it and then you kill the queen and then boom surgery is done unless there are muiltable


[02/22/2021 11:11 PM] weebychild
Savato only affects the heart it'll make a string around it but that string will ruin the scalpel so you have to be very careful with it and there is a loading time for from it before you can use it again


[02/22/2021 11:12 PM] inari_13
Is the game really hard?


[02/22/2021 11:15 PM] weebychild
Sometimes. The strain Triti
Is a pain the ass. So is Deftera


[02/22/2021 11:16 PM] weebychild
See.
Deftera affects the same places as kyriaki but heres the thing. You have to keep these little shits apart while they're running around creating tumors on whatever they're affecting using the lungs is an example here. If they merge together. You have to let them merge at least three times before you can extract the thing what do you extract the same there is a very small time gap for you to patch up the hole where you cut the thing out of the lung


[02/22/2021 11:17 PM] weebychild
They also leaves these little stupid tumors that you have to use the laser tool on to get rid of and that is just annoying having to switch from control to control

I tell u something that happened yesterday about an hour before I made the rape joke that I feel now was foreshadowing


[02/27/2021 7:26 PM] sharpencil
We were playing Among Us & there were 4 people still alive. I was gonna try to talk my way out to vote someone else off, since I was imposter,......... but the game decided to say fuck u & disconnected me.


Seems like foreshadowing to me.


[02/27/2021 7:27 PM] sharpencil
Wat do u think, weeby?

What's the weather like Italy? @Sakura no Fuko


[03/01/2021 8:38 AM] AurorianSakura#7812
It's often very sunny


[03/01/2021 8:38 AM] inari_13
You're lucky you're not living in the U.S. It has been snowing, but the weather is getting better


[03/01/2021 8:39 AM] AurorianSakura#7812
It usually doesn't snow in Italy


[03/01/2021 8:39 AM] AurorianSakura#7812
But as long you live in North Italy, then yes


[03/01/2021 8:39 AM] H o o m a n#5938

Milan is in North Italy


[03/01/2021 8:42 AM] inari_13
It would be cool if there was a United States of Arabia. Hopefully, there's less bombing. @Sakura no Fuko


[03/01/2021 8:42 AM] H o o m a n#5938
We can achieve that with you Osama

[03/01/2021 8:47 AM] inari_13
It can be the United States of Arabia's new national anthem


[03/01/2021 8:48 AM] AurorianSakura#7812

[03/18/2021 9:09 PM] sharpencil
It's an online game in which there's 2 teams. On each team is a person who gives code words. The other teammates must guess wat the code word goes with. The goal is to either guess all of ur words or not pick the black card.



I'm bad at explaining shit, but I'm sure we could catch on quickly

Hearing reviews of the modmic, they all sound very good on sound quality, so long as u're on 1 of the 2 mic options. I'd also have to get a dongle, do it'd come up to about $130 for a gud mic


[03/22/2021 11:08 PM] ragnarok_darkheart
?


[03/22/2021 11:10 PM] sharpencil
I said that I was thinking of getting the modmic in the afternoon. Now, after doing research, I'm tempted to get it more & more than wasting my money on headphones that'd possibly have worse mics

Don't please


[04/01/2021 3:39 AM] crypticrat
Based on my experience, the only math required is like, 20+3 of something like that depending on modifiers, etc. Sometimes there's a bit more, like calculating the Armor Class, or performing spells that require measurements in time and distance, but those are really for extreme and experienced players and masters.


[04/01/2021 3:39 AM] smol._.bean#2493

[04/09/2021 5:45 AM] weebychild
Whats that


[04/09/2021 5:49 AM] sharpencil
It's a youtube original show from SMG4 (who's known for making Mario videos). The plot of the show without giving too much away (meaning I'd want a certain something in the 1sf episode to be a surprise for u) is that it's the future &..... basically u don't matter unless u're good at video games. Some people even give up limbs to robot arms to help improve their skills. Our main character is Tari, who's an amnesiac with a unique power a greedy company wants to get their hands on


[04/09/2021 5:49 AM] sharpencil
It also has a fuck ton of cliffhangers & BOMB finales


[04/09/2021 5:50 AM] sharpencil
It has 2 seasons so far & the crew's working on season 3


[04/09/2021 5:51 AM] weebychild
That actually sounds kinds interesting


[04/09/2021 5:52 AM] sharpencil
Season 2 has a different, improved animation style than season 1 & it'd take some time to get used to the change, but it's a good show

[05/01/2021 6:20 PM] sharpencil
Ok. First, Miia continues to try & "advance" on the main character, even though she knows if they do do it, he'd go to jail & she'd be deported. Second, I feel like Mila was the start to the popularity of "female character wants to embarrass main character" in anime. I mean sure. Nagatoro was already out as a manga, but....... I said anime. Lastly,...... the ending credits seem like they're from a completely different anime. I mean, they have none of the main characters & it has a metal song, while everything else is ur clich√© slice of life music


[05/01/2021 6:21 PM] sharpencil
If u show someone just the Monster Musume ending, they'd think of the show as a completely different thing

Y'all I need help


[05/25/2021 11:01 AM] Elian#3409
What do you do when somebody does this :


[05/25/2021 11:01 AM] Elian#3409
Oh wait I can't send videos


[05/25/2021 11:01 AM] Deleted User
Describe it then...?


[05/25/2021 11:01 AM] Elian#3409
Okay so someone burned a table in class, the table fell down the floor burned as well


[05/25/2021 11:02 AM] Elian#3409
Smbdy saved them and put water on it


[05/25/2021 11:02 AM] Elian#3409
But the teacher gave me responsibility for the class


[05/25/2021 11:03 AM] Elian#3409
And since some of you have seen weird stuff at school before, I thought u might could have some advice on wether I should tell the teacher or not


[05/25/2021 11:04 AM] Deleted User
Is the person who burnt it in any way close to you?


[05/25/2021 11:04 AM] Deleted User
I don't think that really matters.


[05/25/2021 11:04 AM] Deleted User
Well don't tell anyone


[05/25/2021 11:04 AM] Deleted User
But just talk to the person who did it and ask them not to do this kinda shit in class


[05/25/2021 11:04 AM] Deleted User
It's kinda dangerous and not a good outcome


[05/25/2021 11:05 AM] Deleted User
Just give them a little threat and advice and you should be good to go


[05/25/2021 11:11 AM] Elian#3409
The problem is he doesn't care at all


[05/25/2021 11:11 AM] Elian#3409
He doesn't realize he would do it anytime again


[05/25/2021 12:47 PM] Deleted User
Well


[05/25/2021 12:47 PM] Deleted User
Then tell your teacher


[05/25/2021 12:47 PM] Deleted User
Burning things isn't really a good thing


[05/25/2021 12:47 PM] Deleted User
Ask your teacher not to mention your name

How about you play something that's actually good


[06/16/2021 1:23 PM] canna420#4421
How about you let people play what that want and have there own opinions üòå


[06/16/2021 1:24 PM] toadt
My guy, you are aware that you live in 2021 and are on the internet, those things are illegal


[06/16/2021 1:24 PM] toadt
In todays standards

If only we can return to that time


[06/16/2021 1:26 PM] canna420#4421
If only we could return back to when people had morals a sense of humour and technology didn‚Äôt rule the new generations life‚Äôs

100% agree


[06/16/2021 1:30 PM] canna420#4421
It would be a very different world/perspective


[06/16/2021 1:31 PM] canna420#4421
We should also go back to a time of public hanging for pedophiles or sex offenders

Hi y'all. I'm looking for a website where I can make decks for a game that is played very similarly to CAH. The main difference is that, instead of picking randomly, the judge has some control over which black card is used that round.


[07/20/2021 7:08 PM] sparklyy
Anyone know if that might work in Picture Cards Online?


[07/20/2021 7:08 PM] weebychild
Yeah.


[07/20/2021 7:09 PM] weebychild
The judge and host of the game can control the question with the little X button in the top right corner.


[07/20/2021 7:09 PM] sparklyy
Sweet, thank you!


[07/20/2021 7:09 PM] weebychild
Your welcome


[07/20/2021 7:12 PM] sparklyy
Looks like other people have had this idea too üòÉ Is it possible to save decks for future use?


[07/20/2021 7:18 PM] weebychild
Not Really. Closest thing to that is the recently played otherwise you will have to look up the deck


[07/20/2021 7:18 PM] sparklyy
Okay, good to know


[07/21/2021 6:34 AM] qiqi_impact
@Weeby why did you tell him that? it's saved to your player


[07/21/2021 6:34 AM] weebychild
Oh it is? It never worked for me so i thought it worked like that for everyone

[07/21/2021 6:36 AM] weebychild

It‚Äôs on site, just put all the pedos and racists and that on blast till they quit


[02/13/2022 12:57 AM] koda#1760
we have so far but like


[02/13/2022 12:57 AM] koda#1760
there is only so much that us normal people can do


[02/13/2022 12:57 AM] koda#1760
we can call them out for it but


[02/13/2022 12:58 AM] koda#1760
that only helps to a point.


[02/13/2022 12:58 AM] koda#1760

[02/13/2022 12:58 AM] cyberkrakenofficial
Yeah but you put someone on blast and piss them off enough eventually it will get so hard for them to do anything that they will quit


[02/13/2022 12:59 AM] koda#1760
yeah, for sure, we've been doing all we can and making people aware who is good and not.

cut a hole into em and put some nasty shit in them like spoiled food or other creative shit

well heres some pro tips... first you have to head over to the nearest hospital tell em yer suicidal.. theyll keep you on a form.. tell the inpatient psych that you hear voices and that you can control alpha brain waves just by thought alone... that you are for the better sense of the term human 2.0 ... thatll send em thru a hooop... firstthe psych will prescribe something for the voices and then for the brain issue you might get some scans n what not.. just play it chill...


[02/16/2022 9:10 AM] the_snowy
youll of course have to remain locked up in that hospital while they figure out ho functional and safe you are to return to society ~3 weeks


[02/16/2022 9:10 AM] the_snowy
with some outpatient followup care


[02/16/2022 9:11 AM] the_snowy

[02/16/2022 9:12 AM] the_snowy

[02/16/2022 9:12 AM] the_snowy

[02/16/2022 9:12 AM] the_snowy

[02/16/2022 9:14 AM] the_snowy
i ctually dont recall if i had a good convo with her or not... but i sorta get the impression she dug me


[02/16/2022 9:14 AM] Count Shadow#8415
Yep seizures are a pain and when I was diagnosed I was told I could have every type of seizure anyway why are we talking about me I‚Äôm not that interesting.


[02/16/2022 9:16 AM] the_snowy
you werent a moment ago tru that sorta focused on meeeeeeee.....but now that self interest is off to the side for the moment... sorta interested in yer story, shortie üòõ


[02/16/2022 9:17 AM] the_snowy
i mean come to think of it i wonder if you r her üòõ that would be mad weird coincidence but more importantly id have more questions to add to my list.

[02/16/2022 9:28 AM] the_snowy
its 330am my time n im still up. maybe you neeeed to gulp on some mixt energy drinks. (powder but damn packs a punch! lots of caffeine)


[02/16/2022 9:29 AM] Count Shadow#8415
@The_Snowy I think I‚Äôll go to bed cause if I don‚Äôt my wife will kill me


[02/16/2022 9:30 AM] the_snowy
ah when my wife was around and bed time was calllled.... i was snugggled up real close to her with my feet intertwined with hers and my right HAND was around her cupping one of her booobs...made each n every night enjoyable. @ANT5042  @RoO  might know what im talking bout.

[02/16/2022 3:32 PM] the_snowy
Oh yea sounds exotic. Long nails n all. I could go for a goood back scratching myself.


[02/16/2022 3:32 PM] anarchy4237

[02/16/2022 3:32 PM] the_snowy
Sounds intense.


[02/16/2022 3:33 PM] anarchy4237
i honestly cant remember some of it


[02/16/2022 3:35 PM] the_snowy
Sounds typical. Memory is great remembering just the key‚Äôfacts ‚Äò discarding some off the rest.


[02/16/2022 3:36 PM] anarchy4237
well i freaked the fuck out this morning cuz i heard shit in my kitchen


[02/16/2022 3:36 PM] anarchy4237
she was cookin breakfast and i walk in with a glock in my hand


[02/16/2022 3:36 PM] the_snowy
I dunno tho if I got with a chickadeee that was going to maim me in the process of delivering great pleasure‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd remember it all. From the way she bit my ear lobe to the way her nails left welts on my back‚Ä¶all while I‚Äôm shoving my tongue down her throat and running my hands up n down her back mmmm. Would be a great memory.


[02/16/2022 3:37 PM] anarchy4237
that is a vivid description snow


[02/16/2022 3:37 PM] the_snowy
Ah you call yer Peter a glock? I haven‚Äôt given my any pet names myself


[02/16/2022 3:38 PM] anarchy4237

[02/16/2022 3:38 PM] the_snowy
Oh makes sense..small peen big gun kinda dude?


[02/16/2022 3:38 PM] anarchy4237

[02/16/2022 3:47 PM] the_snowy
I dunno surprised they don‚Äôt have better protections there. Weird sauce doesn‚Äôt sound Good. Personally I‚Äôd just go full throttle cannibal I mean jizz sandwich or a chunk of cooked human meat? Steal a packet of ramen noodles from dead bunk mate and throw in some chicken seasonings


[02/16/2022 3:48 PM] anarchy4237
ramen packets like 15 bucks in commissary so youd have gold on your hands


[02/16/2022 3:49 PM] the_snowy

Kiss me goodbye and write me while I‚Äôm gone

Goodbye my sweetheart, hello Vietnam

America has heard the bugle call

And you know it involves us one and all

I don‚Äôt suppose that war will ever end 

There‚Äôs fighting that will break us up again 

Goodbye my darling, hello Vietnam

A hill to take, a battle to be won

Kiss me goodbye and write me while I‚Äôm gone

Goodbye my sweat heart, hello Vietnam

A ship is waiting for us at the dock

America has trouble to be stopped 

We must stop communism in that land

Or freedom will start slipping through our hands

I hope and pray some day the world will learn

That fires we don‚Äôt put out will bigger burn 

We must save freedom now, at any cost

Or someday our own freedom will be lost 

Kiss me goodbye and write me while I‚Äôm gone

Goodbye my sweetheart, hello Vietnam

[06/19/2022 5:55 AM] jclb0820
Exactly like ok get mad you‚Äôre just proving how much of a immature person you are


[06/19/2022 5:56 AM] Ciljia#8329
Fr


[06/19/2022 5:56 AM] Ciljia#8329
Its just annoying how sensitive people are


[06/19/2022 5:56 AM] jclb0820
Exactly like really offended over fuckin cartoon characters


[06/19/2022 5:57 AM] Ciljia#8329
Exactly like the big dr Suess ban oml


[06/19/2022 5:58 AM] jclb0820
Ikr and the fact that I grew up reading green eggs and ham what‚Äôs wrong with dr.suess books


[06/19/2022 5:58 AM] jclb0820
Not saying that he was a good person but they shouldn‚Äôt ban his books


[06/19/2022 5:59 AM] Ciljia#8329
Thats what i was raised on too i mean i loved them as a child tea he was a pretty horrible person if you know his story but like for instance in the what i saw on mulberry street one it was canceled because one line said a Chinese man using sticks like thats what he uses üòÇ


[06/19/2022 6:00 AM] jclb0820
Well that‚Äôs what I mean cause apparently he was having an affair behind his dying wife‚Äôs back


[06/19/2022 6:01 AM] Ciljia#8329
Yea allegedly but well thats who he was and we shouldn‚Äôt remember someone for the negative things but rather the positive


[06/19/2022 6:01 AM] jclb0820
Exactly


[06/19/2022 6:02 AM] jclb0820
He created alot of childrens books which were great some were made into movies


[06/19/2022 6:03 AM] Ciljia#8329
Yes and that is what we should know him by and yes you should know both ups and downs but keep it positive we don‚Äôt want to be dragged down with all the negativity


[06/19/2022 6:04 AM] jclb0820
Right like we all have our ups and downs and we don‚Äôt like when people bring up the negativity that we did back up we want to live positive and that‚Äôs what people should do instead of being negative about every little thing and get offended


[06/19/2022 6:05 AM] Ciljia#8329
I fully agree


[06/19/2022 6:06 AM] jclb0820
I have small group of friends because of how people act I don‚Äôt want to be around someone who can‚Äôt have differences and not be respectful of each other‚Äôs opinions


[06/19/2022 6:07 AM] Ciljia#8329
Yea like I understand that you may not necessarily agree but it wont end the world


[06/19/2022 6:07 AM] Ciljia#8329
Just gotta accept for who they are


[06/19/2022 6:08 AM] jclb0820

[06/19/2022 6:08 AM] Ciljia#8329

[06/19/2022 6:08 AM] Ciljia#8329

[06/19/2022 6:14 AM] Ciljia#8329
Yea that makes sense its a way to relax and relieve stress but you gotta be careful smoking though


[06/19/2022 6:14 AM] jclb0820

[06/19/2022 6:15 AM] Ciljia#8329
Yes i know that for sure


[06/19/2022 6:15 AM] Ciljia#8329
Hope you can quit successfully I believe in you


[06/19/2022 6:15 AM] jclb0820
Let me tell you when I go through the quitting process let some sensitive person come at me I‚Äôll not hold back


[06/19/2022 6:16 AM] Ciljia#8329

Four years of Wasting money on cigarettes


[06/19/2022 6:18 AM] Ciljia#8329

[06/19/2022 6:20 AM] jclb0820
I was broke and couldn‚Äôt get it and got paid bought cigarettes again


[06/19/2022 6:20 AM] Ciljia#8329
And if that is the snack for you yes they may be a little expensive but its worth it to quit the cigarettes


[06/19/2022 6:21 AM] jclb0820
Trying to save up for a car and I‚Äôm realizing I could get one quicker if I quit

i love kobe, but he isn't better than kareem respectfully


[08/20/2022 2:45 AM] kodaaaa.
they both played 20 seasons


[08/20/2022 2:46 AM] Ciljia#8329
Thats true


[08/20/2022 2:47 AM] kodaaaa.
His stats are better, he has more awards, EVERYONE loves kobe and everyone loves him for the minset he had but Kareem had a bigger impact (especially off the court)


[08/20/2022 2:47 AM] kodaaaa.
Kobe is top 5, not top 3.


[08/20/2022 2:48 AM] Ciljia#8329
I am totally fine with this Analysis


[08/20/2022 2:48 AM] Ciljia#8329

It timed out and said host error so I'm not sure


[07/10/2023 5:33 PM] cyborg_9
Yeah than the admin of the domain shut it manually


[07/10/2023 5:33 PM] cyborg_9
For whatever reason


[07/10/2023 5:34 PM] nbrad2021

Oh shit, I really loved the website. Is there any administrator I can write to? I had there my custom deck which I was upgrading and developing for several years. It would be nice to save it somehow, because it cost me a lot of time and creativity.

Cyborg ‚Äî 07/11/2023 8:14 PM
I'm rly sad this happened so early on
Like I just got to know the funny shit there and now it's gone right away
But why
Hello91 ‚Äî 07/11/2023 8:21 PM
I mean I wouldn't say early on. Site has been up for almost 12 years now and azala kind of hated the place. If he had been on the site more often and seen some of the shit that was posted on there it would've been shut down almost 2 years ago
Cyborg ‚Äî 07/11/2023 8:22 PM
Still sad tho
Hello91 ‚Äî 07/11/2023 8:22 PM
Yeah still sad
